            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p n="1">1. That by diſcourſing and arguing a point ſo acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgly Great, ſo Fundamental and Eſſential, not only to Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity,
<pb facs="tcp:99379:12"/> but to Natural Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and all Morality: If it ſhall be acceptable to you, as I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not but truſt it will, becauſe it is ſo agreeable to Scripture; I may reconcile my ſelf to your more, not only Favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able, but Deep <hi>Conſideration</hi> in <hi>ſo great Points</hi> of <hi>the ſure Word of Prophecy,</hi> as I have hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore preſented to you; and have made ſome Reference unto, in this very Doctrine of Repentance, as moſt Connatu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral to it.</p>
                  <p>For though I know there is a Difference between ſuch a plain, and unconteſtable Truth of Scripture, as Repentance is; and what lies in the darker
<pb facs="tcp:99379:13"/> Folds and Plaits of Scripture, in the <hi>Hieroglyphick Figures,</hi> and <hi>Prophetical Numbers</hi> of it; and it may ſeem therefore <hi>impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble,</hi> or <hi>highly improbable,</hi> that <hi>I eſpecially</hi> ſhould attain <hi>the Cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainty of the Words of Truth,</hi> to <hi>anſwer</hi> and <hi>apologize the Words of Truth,</hi> in <hi>the great dependencies of Prophecy, to them that ſend to me for them.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But, as it is well urged a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt the <hi>enemies of the Natu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Religion,</hi> as well as <hi>Revealed;</hi> that though there cannot be <hi>Mathematical Demonſtration</hi> of thoſe <hi>Great Truths,</hi> as of <hi>Eu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clid</hi>'s <hi>Propoſitions;</hi> yet there may be <hi>as Convictive Proofs,</hi> in their kind, and <hi>as ſatisfactory to

                  <p>THERE is no more Univerſal Notion in the Soul of Man in thoſe Things, wherein he hath to do with God, or even with Man, or with Himſelf, then to Repent; that is, to be ſorry for what he hath done Amiſs, and wherein he hath Offended: and to Reſolve, and Promiſe to Amend, and to do the Evil he hath done, no more; It is fitted as a great Inſtrument of Reconciliation, and a ſecond ſtate of Innocency; a Reſerve after the Ruin and Shipwrack of our Firſt Innocency, a Remedy, a Reparation after, the firſt Advantages of doing well, are loſt; And it is the infinite Grace of God in a
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99379:20"/> Mediator, that there is ſuch a Notion in the World; It preſerves it from being a Hell in regard either of the extremity, and utmoſt Rages of Wickedneſs; or of the Horrors, and Fury of Deſpair. It is the infinite Grace of God in a Redeemer, That there is a <hi>Place of Repentance,</hi> as the Apoſtle calls it, <hi>Heb.</hi> 12. that is, place, and room for it in mans Heart, and that there is place for it in the Acceptance of God; that God does not ſcorn, and utterly reject it, againſt him, that hath once ſinned; That he is not inexorable, and not to be intreated concerning it; For how woful, and even Helliſhly Miſerable would man be without it? That the Nature of Man is inclin'd to offer, and accept ſuch Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, one towards another, and ſo, that there are mutual Forgiveneſſes among men, and not unap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peaſable hatreds; and that there is in a mans own Conſcience a preparedneſs to acquieſce, to be ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, to Reſt, and to be Appeaſed upon finding in the Soul, and Action, a ſorrow for ſin, and Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation from it: All this keeps the World from be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing abſolutely Hell.</p>
                  <p>For Sorrow, Diſlike, Trouble, Remorſe, for what a Man hath done evil, move a man to review, to acknowledgment, to bewailing, to confeſſion, to change, and reformation, to a new courſe of Life, and Action.</p>
                  <p>Seeing then Man is ſuch a fallen, ſuch a Peccant, and offending Nature; it is infinite grace in God, that there is ſuch a Notion, ſuch Action in mans Soul, as Repentance; and that there is not an utter irreconcilableneſs, an unpardonableneſs after Offenſe committed: neither in Heaven nor on Earth; not in the Court of Heaven, nor in the Court of Human
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99379:20"/> Nature one towards another; nor in the Court of a mans Conſcience within himſelf. If it were not ſo, every ſin would be like the <hi>Blaſphemy against the Holy Spirit,</hi> Matt. 12. Unpardonable; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe Unpardonable, Impenitable, <hi>or not to be Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pented of;</hi> and that <hi>not only in this World,</hi> but in <hi>that which is to come;</hi> the World would become a Theater of ſin, and damnation; even a Hell, without any Chancery, any Appeal to Grace, to Mercy; or Relenting of Repentance from the hopes of Mercy, the reverence and awes of Goodneſs, and Forgive<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs.</p>
                  <p>Now that which lies looſe and ſcattered, or diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeminated, ſown through the whole human Creati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; That, the word of God, eſpecially in the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, in the <hi>New Testament;</hi> that the Spirit of God hath collected into a more full, and ſolemn Doct<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rine, and open'd the Foundation, and laid bare, and in view the root, or the great place of it; How it hath room, and reception; what are the Sources, ſprings of Efficacy, from which it Riſes: even in the Sacrifice, Blood, and Redemption of Chriſt; and the mighly Efficacy, and Grace of the Divine Spirit; what is that <hi>godly ſorrow,</hi> which is given by God, as the <hi>Elaboratory</hi> or the Inſtrument of God for the Operation of it; what are the Laws and Rules of it; the true form and conſtitution of it; what are the motives, and inward conſiderations mooving to it; what are the ſigns, and evidences of its Truth; what is the proper time, and ſpace for it; It reſolves the Scruples or Caſes of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience, that may ariſe in the Soul of Man concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing it; it ſhews the great Fruit, certain Benefit, and Advantage of it.</p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99379:21"/>
                  <p>And all theſe are either moſt innately reſiding or ſome way reducible to this great, and excellent Context of the Apoſtle; in which regard I have choſen it, and ſhall endeavour to bring Light ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cordingly to it; and according to theſe heads, I will by the grace of God endeavour to Diſcourſe it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In regard it is <hi>Repentance to Salvation,</hi> and that <hi>Salvation is no other, but in Chriſt alone,</hi> Acts 4.12. it plainly ſhews, That the whole <hi>Redemption</hi> and <hi>Salvation</hi> of <hi>Christ,</hi> is the proper Baſis, and Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of it; the whole <hi>Area,</hi> Court, Space and moſt <hi>proper place</hi> of it; and that the whole Notion and Spirit of it, as any way Commenſurate to, or extended upon the whole human Nature, hath its Riſe, and Original; flows from ſome Communicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the human Nature from Jeſus Chriſt, the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemer; and that yet the word of God and his Goſpel only Reveals it fully and genuinely; and his ſpirit is the ſupreme Operator of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Here is plainly laid down to us the Elabora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, or Inſtrument God hath prepared in infinite Wiſdom, and Grace, and inlay'd the Soul with, in order to Repentance. Firſt, as it is a Natural Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection ſubſervient to it; and then as it is Sanctified by God to ſo great an end. <hi>Godly ſorrow,</hi> or <hi>ſorrow after,</hi> and <hi>according to God worketh down Repentance,</hi> or brings it forth; a ſorrow oppoſed to the <hi>ſorrow</hi> of <hi>the World,</hi> that <hi>worketh Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. In that it is, 1. <hi>Repentance to Salvation,</hi> ef<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fectual to it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Repentance</hi> not to be <hi>Repented of.</hi>

                  <p n="3">3. In that it is, to, or <hi>lays hold of Salvaetion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. In that it riſes not from an earthly ſpring, or any <hi>ſorrow,</hi> not <hi>after God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In all theſe Regards, it yeilds juſt reaſon to Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe the true Laws, and Rules; the Frame, and true conſtitution; the motives, means and conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations for; the ſigns, and evidences of ſincere Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The admirable Fruit and Benefit of it is moſt viſibly, and illuſtriouſly ſet forth before us in thoſe words, <hi>It is Repentance to Salvation, not to be repented of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is <hi>to Salvation;</hi> It is a great and certain ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity againſt Ruin, Damnation, Periſhing for ever.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It ſhall not only be a ſecurity from Damnati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, but an aſſurance of a ſtate of Life, Glory, Bleſſedneſs.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There ſhall never be the leaſt cauſe to Repent, to look back with Sorrow, or Regret, that we have <hi>Repented.</hi> For we ſhall find, we have loſt no good, we have run upon no evil, in having <hi>Repented.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. It ſhall give us Reaſon of everlaſting Joy, Rejoycing, Triumph, Bleſſing and Adoring God in Chriſt, we have ſo by his grace <hi>Repented to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation.</hi>
                  </p>

                  <p>Theſe are the heads, I Propoſe by Divine Grace, and Aſſiſtance, to Diſcourſe the Doctrin, and grace of Repentance upon; but I find it is in the firſt place neceſſary to give ſome ſhort deſcriptions of the thing, <hi>Repentance,</hi> according to the very impor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance of the word; and of the General Importance, and Nature of the Notion, or the thing it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The words us'd by the Spirit of God in the Old Teſtament, are either that ſtrict word <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap>o before. On this Account we meet ſo often with the words of Turning in the Old Teſtament, and being Converted, and Turning in the New.</p>
                  <p>The moſt proper and ſtrict words in the <hi>New Teſtament,</hi> are either an <hi>After Care,</hi> a Reflection with ſorrow, and ſollicitouſneſs upon what a man hath done, with Trouble, He did ſo; and a care, a caution not to do ſo any more for the time to come; or an <hi>after-mind,</hi> an <hi>after-wit,</hi> an <hi>after un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtanding, a tranſmentation, a new Mind, a new Heart and Spirit.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To ſpeak of it therefore in the general; Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is given by God, as a mighty Spiritual Inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, or Engine in the hand of his Grace, in the <hi>Arm of God made Bare,</hi> by which the ſinful Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, in every true Penitent, is unhing'd, uncen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter'd from ſin, and corruption. It is a return of the Soul home to it ſelf, after a Spiritual Phrenſy, and Madneſs; The <hi>Prodigal</hi> is ſaid <hi>to come to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf:</hi>
                     <pb n="7" facs="tcp:99379:22"/> It is a return to its <hi>Fathers Houſe,</hi> after a long bewildred State; <hi>This my Son was loſt, and is found.</hi> But beyond all this, it is a Spiritual Reſurrection, a return from Death to Life; <hi>This my Son was Dead, and is A Live,</hi> Luke 15.</p>
                  <p>And indeed, as there is no notion of Scripure, that is more ſuited to expreſs the corrupt Nature of Man, than Death; ſo the firſt Threat Ran, <hi>In the day thou eateſt thereof,</hi>

                  </p>
                  <p>This is the general Notion of Repentance; but it may be further Explain'd in theſe three Particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lars, and yet in a general way.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Repentance is an inward, ſincere, habitual Change of the Heart, and of the deſign, and pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe; and ſo of the outward Action, and Courſe of Life, and Conduct of a mans ways; ariſing from an utter diſlike of his, former Counſel, Purpoſe and Deſign, and the courſe of Converſation, Life, and Action proceeding from it; ſo that it becomes wholly New: This is the generel Nature of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99379:23"/> as it looks to the government of a mans ſelf, and of his Actions: Now this in Scripture, and Evangelical Repentance is the change from ſin to Holineſs, from a worldly ſtate, and converſation to an Heavenly; and from the Creature, to God, and to Chriſt; an utter diſlike of, and trouble at the former Regiment, and ſteerage of a mans courſe, ſo as utterly to forſake it; and with ſorrow, ſhame, and aſtoniſhment, to ſay to his ſinful ways, ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to the Rules of Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Purity, <hi>Get ye hence, and what have I to do any more with you?</hi> I will now guide my ſelf by the word of my God, and hate every falſe way, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 119.

Marc. 9.43. &amp;c.</note> anguiſh, and miſery, come upon them; then they <hi>mourn at the last, when they ſee all conſumed,</hi> and ſay, <hi>How have we hated Inſtruction, and deſpiſed Reproof!</hi> Thus in Scripture, and Evangelical Repentance; there is a fear of Hell, and an Eternity of Miſery; <hi>A cutting off the right hand, and Foot, a pulling out the right Eye,</hi> when any of them are underſtood in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, to have <hi>offended,</hi> and to continue to <hi>offend;</hi> under the ſenſe; <hi>It is better to enter into Life, blind, halt, than having two Hands, Eyes, Feet: maimed, rather than to be caſt into Hell</hi> whole; where <hi>their Worm dyeth not, and their Fire is not quenched. There is a ſeeking Honour, Glory and immortality,</hi> By ingaging in Repentance into a <hi>patient continuance in well doing;</hi> on the other ſide <hi>tribulation, and anguiſh, indignation, and wrath,</hi> vehemently Agitate the Spirit, and Thoughts, againſt a continued courſe of doing evil. <hi>What ſhall it profit a Man if he gain the whole World,
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99379:24"/> and looſe his own Soul; or what ſhall a man give in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>change for his Soul? I ſay unto you, my Freinds, fear not them that Kill the Body, and have no more that they can do; but I will forewarn you, whom you ſhall fear, fear him, who after hath killed, hath power to caſt into Hell, yea,</hi> I <hi>ſay unto you, fear him: Oh! that they were wiſe, that they underſtood this, that they would conſider their latter end: I ſay unto you, repent, elſe you ſhall likewiſe periſh; who hath forewarned you to fly from the wrath to come; God hath commanded all men every where to Repent; becauſe he hath ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pointed a day, in which he will Judg the World: Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto Life: Repent, and turn your ſelves, that Iniquity may not be your ruin; Repent, and be Converted, that your ſins may be blotted out, when the times of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>freſhing ſhall come forth from the preſence of the Lord; Repent, for the Kingdom of Heaven is at hand.</hi> Thus Scripture having theſe two handles of the Soul, Fear of Evil, and deſire of happineſs, mightily moves it to Repentance by them; it holds theſe two great Globes, the World of Happineſs, and the World of Miſery, both preſent, and to come; and ſo with a Scepter ſo Potent, it ſways the Spirits of Men; as the Divine Spirit, that dwells in it, plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes.</p>
                  <p>I have thus far given the Nature of <hi>Repentance</hi> in general, that it may be the better underſtood, what we are now to Diſcourſe: I begin therefore with the firſt Head: that <hi>Repentance,</hi> which is ſo Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>municated to the very inward ſenſe of mankind, ſprings from, and hath its whole place in the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt. The Apoſtle ſpeaks of <hi>Eſau,</hi> that he <hi>found no place for Repentance;</hi> there is a pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99379:25"/> 
                     <hi>place for Repentance.</hi> And this, I ſay, is the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demption of Chriſt, that hath laid the <hi>Baſis,</hi> the Foundation of Repentance; that hath ſpread over Human Nature, the notion and ſenſe of Repentance. And where it is truly wrought, the Spirit of Chriſt takes it from Chriſt, and gives it to the Soul, and it is accepted only in, and through Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore to be underſtood, that there had no <hi>Place</hi> been Found for <hi>Repentance,</hi> had it not been for the undertaking of Chriſt; For Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance being a rational Act, it muſt have a Rational Foundation, and Encouragement. If there were then no Mercy, no Forgiveneſs, no Salvation; there could be no Repentance but that of fruitleſs ſorrow, horror, and deſpair: the Repentance of <hi>wailing</hi> and <hi>Gnaſhing the Teeth:</hi> that is, the Repentance that is in Hell, a Repentance without being chang'd or made better. Seeing then Salvation, Forgiveneſs, Mercy are all bound up in the Name of Chriſt; For they are no where elſe; the Redemption of Chriſt is the only foundation of Repentance, ſuch a Repentance as hath in it a change from ſin to Holineſs: <hi>David</hi> gives us this great Inſtruction, Pſal. 130. <hi>There is forgiveneſs with thee, that thou maist be feared;</hi> that <hi>thou maieſt be feared</hi> with the Awes, with the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verences of <hi>Repentance,</hi> there is Forgiveneſs with thee; there had been no place for ſuch Fear of thee, if thou <hi>hadst been ſo extreme to mark what is done a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſs,</hi> as that there had been <hi>no Forgveneſs with thee.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And this is moſt evident alſo in that Doctrin of the Apoſtle before mentioned, concerning the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in the caſe of <hi>Eſau:</hi> When he had <hi>deſpiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed</hi> and <hi>ſold</hi> his <hi>Birth-right,</hi> and would after <hi>Inherit
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99379:25"/> the Bleſſing,</hi> he was <hi>Rejected, or Reprobated</hi> from it; and he <hi>found no place of Repentance,</hi> tho he ſought it, that is, the <hi>bleſſing carefully with Tears;</hi> Heb. 12.17. He found no <hi>Place</hi> of <hi>Repentance,</hi> becauſe he was <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected.</hi> Whether we underſtand it of <hi>Iſaack's,</hi> or of <hi>Eſau's Repentance,</hi> it is much at one: If we un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtand it of <hi>Eſau</hi>'s <hi>Repentance,</hi> finding no place in himſelf; ſo it hath this ſenſe; That <hi>Repentance</hi> flies into Deſpair, if it be not accepted, when we tender it: Or if we underſtand it of <hi>Iſaac</hi> not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penting,</hi> when <hi>Eſau</hi> wept to procure it, but ſtill fixed the bleſſing on <hi>Jacob,</hi> it is ſtill the ſame thing; for if God did not pleaſe to accept our Repentance, or himſelf, to <hi>Repent</hi> in a ſenſe worthy of him; our <hi>Repentance</hi> would be to no more purpoſe, than <hi>Eſau</hi>'s <hi>Tears,</hi> or than the weeping in Hell; we ſhould be <hi>Rejected,</hi> and <hi>Reprobated</hi> in our <hi>Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The <hi>Law,</hi> that ſays, <hi>curſed is every one that hath not continued in all things, to do them,</hi> Gal. 3. and <hi>Do this</hi> in the firſt Act, and Live, leaves no room for <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance;</hi> but the <hi>bringing</hi> in a <hi>better</hi> hope even pardon of Sin, Attonement, and Reconciliarion in the Blood of Chriſt, does, <hi>by this we draw nigh to God in Repentance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Heb.</hi> 7.17.</note> and are not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jected</hi> but <hi>Accepted.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Here then there is Rational Foundation, and Encouragement for <hi>Repentance;</hi> becauſe it ſhall not be thrown upon, and into Deſpair; there is <hi>Hope concerning this thing in the Goſpel;</hi> let us therefore by <hi>Repentance</hi> preſs home, and return to God in Chriſt.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Again, <hi>Repentance</hi> is the gift of God, a Grace given by him; If God, <hi>peradventure, will give Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> and, then <hi>hath God granted unto the Gentiles
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99379:26"/> Repentance unto Life;</hi> Chriſt is a <hi>Prince and Saviour raiſed up by God to give Repentance,</hi>

God therefore does not give ſuch Grace in Vain; but when he hath ſettled a Fund of Pardon, Reconcilement, and Salvation: He firſt ſettled that; elſe Repentance had been in Vain, as the Eye would have been, if God had not firſt made Light; Light is alone in Chriſt: He does not give Grace that ſhall be to no purpoſe, he gives no man the <hi>Repentance</hi> he will not Accept and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don upon: He does not expoſe his own Grace to Damnation, or to the Flames of Hell; nor does he give any Grace, but in the Mediator, in the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er: So the Redemption of Chriſt muſt needs be the Foundation of Repentance; there had never been elſe the Notion the poſſibility of Repentance; there had never been the ſound, or report of it heard in the World.</p>
                  <p>This then being the Foundation, let us take the true degrees of the ſtate of Repentance in two <hi>Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſitions.</hi>

                     <note place="margin">Rom. 10.</note> or <hi>down into the Deep,</hi> or <hi>beyond the Sea for it; It is in his Heart:</hi> So the Knowledg of it is
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99379:26"/> very near him: God hath alſo put a Tenderneſs, towards it, a Flexibleneſs, he hath made the Soul of Man, the Conſcience, and Affections plyable to it: And this, we ſhall ſee, is from the Mediator.</p>
                  <p>I confeſs, this may ſeem hard to be underſtood; ſeeing Repentance is fitted and prepared for a ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful fallen Creature: Now in that man was at firſt Created upright, and perfect, and good; and what <hi>was written in mans Heart,</hi> was <hi>written</hi> there in his Creation; what place could there be for Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance? <hi>Adam</hi> was ſo <hi>righteous a perſon</hi> he could <hi>need no Repentance,</hi> why then ſhould <hi>repentance be written in his Heart?</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And yet notwithſtanding, we find by experi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence, and univerſal Obſervation; It is a notion very intimate to every mans Soul, and even in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dear'd to his Thoughts: Every man ſeems to be glad, there is ſuch a notion, ſuch an Idea in his Soul; and they that hear of it, and know it from Scripture, acknowledg immediately the goodneſs and reaſonableneſs of it, and rejoyce in it: And tho a man do not fall down right upon the Practiſe of it, yet he is pleaſed with the promiſe to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, he will at ſome time repent, and reform, and grow better; and there is proportionably a general Faith, Repentance will be accepted, and the repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Offender Pardoned. If men are told, they muſt of neceſſity change, repent and reform from their ſinful courſes: If they are perſwaded to become o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther men, they are not ſo apt to be Angry, but rather ſay,<note place="margin">Acts 24.25.</note> 
                     <hi>They will take a convenient time for it;</hi> tho Temptati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on carry them away, yet they heartily Embrace the thing it ſelf, as to the aſſent, and ſubmiſſion,
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99379:27"/> and acknowledgment, that it ought to be ſo. Men are convinc'd, that while they defer to enter into the Practiſe, that yet they ought to <hi>repent.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I aſſert is through the Grace of the Redeem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er; I would therefore endeavour to find out, how this notion of repentance comes to be ſo very inti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mate and connatural to mans Soul; and with ſuch a Engraven, Engrafted Hope, and belief of Pardon upon it? How it comes to paſs, that the demands of Natural Conſcience do ſo wonderfully lead to Repentance; and are like thoſe of Natural Juſtice, and common Honeſty; of Soberneſs, and Temper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ance, of Truth, Mercy, and Compaſſion, or what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever is accepted in the World as morally good and excellent; and even as the deep impreſſions of natural Religion, ſenſe of God, and obedience to him?

By the ſame ſenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Soul, we allow the one, we allow the other alſo: If the remains of natural Conſcience call a man out to the one, they ſummon him to the other alſo: And yet all this, I affirm, is from the Grace of the Redeemer.

                  <p>
                     <hi>General</hi> 1. I begin therefore with a <hi>Deſcription</hi> of <hi>Sorrow,</hi> firſt, as it is a Natural Affection, or Paſſion of the Humane Nature; and then as it is ſanctified by God, or as it becomes a <hi>Sorrow after God,</hi> and is fitted to ſo great an End and Purpoſe; and as it is ſo, it is counterdiſtinguiſh'd to <hi>worldly Sorrow, that worketh Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>General.</hi> 2. I will conſider the excellent Uſe and Service of <hi>godly Sorrow,</hi> to ſo great an End and Put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, as <hi>the working Repentance to Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>General</hi> 3. I will open the Wiſdom of God, and the <hi>Reaſonableneſs</hi> of his making uſe of Sorrow, and fitting it as <hi>after himſelf,</hi> or <hi>according to himſelf,</hi> to ſo great an End and Purpoſe; and that according to the very <hi>Reaſon</hi> and <hi>Nature of Things,</hi> it could not
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99379:33"/> be otherwiſe, but that <hi>godly ſorrow</hi> muſt be ſo made uſe of above, and before any other <hi>Affection;</hi> and that it becomes him, <hi>by whom, and for whom are all things</hi> ſo to make uſe of it.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>General</hi> 1. For the <hi>Deſcription</hi> of this <hi>Affection</hi> of <hi>godly Sorrow:</hi> Firſt, as it is a <hi>Natural Affection,</hi> or <hi>Paſſion</hi> of the Humane Nature; and then as it is ſanctified by God, or becomes <hi>Sorrow ofter God,</hi> and is counter-diſtinguiſh'd to the <hi>ſorrow of the World,</hi> that <hi>worketh Death.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Sorrow</hi> then, as it is an <hi>Affection,</hi> or <hi>Paſſion</hi> of the Humane Nature, muſt be conſidered Two ways; and each of them muſt be applied to the <hi>Sorrow</hi> that <hi>works Repentance,</hi> or to <hi>Sorrow according to God;</hi> and ſo a different and oppoſite Sorrow to the <hi>ſorrow of this World.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. Sorrow, that is a Humane Paſſion, or Affection, muſt either begin in the Body, and ſo paſſeth from the Soul, and aſcends up to the Spirit of a Man; or it begins in the higher Region, the Spirit, and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcends by the Soul into the Body, and makes Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions ſuitable to its own Nature there; and the Body is govern'd according to this Affection, and to its Place, Eſtimation, Power with, and Intereſt in the Spirit.</p>
                  <p>Now indeed <hi>all Affection,</hi> and even <hi>Paſſion,</hi> to ſpeak moſt ſtrictly and properly, is in the Spirit; For it is all one to matter, how it be uſed; or into what Form it is made to paſs: or out of what, or in diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>junction from what Form it is forc'd to move: So that All we feel, by way of ſuffering, or Enjoyment, is by the Spirit's having a Pleaſing, or an Afflicting Senſe of Things: But this I wave, as not ſo neceſſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry

It is an Idolatrous Sorrow, ariſing from an Heart deeply ſet on this World, and glew<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed to it; and ſo goes down into the Vault and Pit of eternal Sorrow: It tends to the Death of the Body; it brings down the <hi>Head to the Grave:</hi> It

                  <p>I come now to the ſecond Head, to ſhew the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent uſe and ſervice, ſorrow after God, yeilds in this wiſe, and holy preparation of it by God to that <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to ſalvation, not to be Repented of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1, In that, ſo great, and principal an Affection of the Soul is given up to God; It hath an uſe, and a ſervice to ſteer the Soul to God; For the Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons are, as the Rudder of the Soul, as the Helm of it, guided by the judgment, as by a Pilot: And theſe affections are all in a Linck, and in a chain: If any one of the principal Affections are mov'd, that mighty Veſſel of the whole Soul is turn'd this way, or that way by a very ſmall thing, as it may ſeem; even by one Affection, becauſe all are joyn'd and united with it: For where Sorrow goes, Love goes, becauſe ſorrow is for the want of ſome good, the Souls deſires; If then ſorrow <hi>be after God,</hi> and for Holineſs; It aſſures, the Soul hath a ſpring<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Love for God and Holineſs, and in the diſtance it apprehends it ſelf from theſe, it laments. Where ſorrow goes, there hatred alſo goes: For ſorrow ariſes from ſome evil that the Soul hates and abhors,
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99379:36"/> that preſſes in upon it: In ſorrow <hi>after God,</hi> ſin, and the wrath, and diſpleaſure of God, is, what the Soul hates; and it finding theſe near, and cloſing upon it, it ſorrows and laments that <hi>they may be caſt out</hi> and removed. And how do theſe, the Love of God, and hatred of ſin <hi>work to Repentance?</hi> And thus alſo it might be ſhewn, How <hi>Fear, Hope, Joy, Delight</hi> move as ſorrow moves. The Apoſtle knowing with what a ſtrength, and force, and pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſence the Affections move, writes to the <hi>Coloſſians,</hi> c. 2. <hi>To ſet their Affections on things above:</hi> For if the Affections are ſo ſet, the Spirit and Soul will be ſo ſet, and therefore the whole man will be ſo ſet.

                     </gap> the contrary, the <hi>ſorrow of the World</hi> carries the ſtrength of the Soul, the Affections on the World; which not able to ſuſtain and bear up an Immortal Spirit, it often deſtroys the Body by Violence; and leaves the Soul to ſink alſo, the Spirit to fall down from God, which is the Death of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Affection of ſorrow, is the Affection that is moſt properly converſant about ſin, and the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſequences of it; the wrath, and diſpleaſure of God, the curſe, and evil. Now then, as ſin is a depar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture from God the fountain of Life, and happineſs, the ſupreme good, and ſo uſhers in, and introduces all unhappineſs: ſo <hi>ſorrow</hi> that is after God, begins in the apprehenſion of God, and of his Law; and ſo deſcends on all the evil conſequential, or follow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on the loſs of God: But the <hi>ſorrow of the World,</hi> not beginning with God, fetters it ſelf with the Evils which preſs upon it, with relation to the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent World; which can never be well removed with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out removing the principal cauſe, ſin, and the diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleaſure
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99379:37"/> of God for it: But to this the <hi>ſorrow of this World</hi> hath no regard, and ſo is never cured, but becomes of a peice with the ſorrows of the ſecond Death: For ſo all ſorrow here not Healed by the <hi>repentance to Salvation, not to be repented of,</hi> (which Heals the <hi>ſorrow after God</hi>) becomes one with the ſorrows of Hell, and <hi>everlasting wailing:</hi> By god<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly ſorrow therefore, ſorrow is made to be its own Death, and Plagues. <hi>For working repentance to Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation, never to be repented of, When it is ſorrow after God, it is the Deſtruction of all ſorrow.</hi> For it can be no longer, but, as Scripture ſpeaks, <hi>forrow and ſighing ſhall flee away, and there ſhall be no more ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row.</hi> As it came in by ſin, ſo by ſin Repented of, and Pardoned, it for ever ceaſes, and vaniſhes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>way: So ſorrow is converſant about its proper ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject, and cauſe, and it hath the great effect of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moving it ſelf; and of it ſelf looſing it ſelf in that Joy, that follows upon the <hi>Salvation</hi> of that <hi>Repentance</hi> it ſelf hath wrought; which muſt needs make an end of Sorrow, or Perfects it into it ſelf <hi>never to be Repented of.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. The ſerviceableneſs of <hi>godly ſorrow to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance,</hi> is, that this Affection of all the Affections, or Paſſions of the human Soul, is that which makes it wiſe, and conſiderative; ſeeing <hi>Repentance then, that is to Salvation,</hi> is a moſt Wiſe, and prudent grace; This Affection of ſorrow is moſt prepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tory, and contributary to it. The ſorrow after God is no Ignorant, or unreaſonable Paſſion, or Affection; call'd <hi>Attrition;</hi> no ſuperſtitious Pen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nance, or ceremony of Sorrow, not a mere ſoft<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, and diſſolving into Tears; not any deſultory Paſſion, that falls into ſome <hi>morning Dew,</hi> or as it
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99379:37"/> were, <hi>heat Drops;</hi> but a deep inward trouble, that we have offended God, and ſinn'd againſt him, and endangered our ſelves to Eternity by our ſins: And however, there may be at firſt ſome ſudden ſtroke, or Impreſſion, and a Paſſion upon it, that may go off; yet it is indeed a ſpring that diſ-em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bogues it ſelf through the whole courſe of a Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtians Life: There is a ſorrow, and a relenting of Soul, that is a ſoft Dew, or Diſtillation from the Soul upon it ſelf, that makes it very tender, hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble, and Apprehenſive of the Evil of Sin; of the Ingratitude, and unthankfulneſs of having ſinned againſt God, and given Offence to the Eyes of his Holineſs, and of his Glory. And as this ariſes from underſtanding, ſo it begets underſtanding, and cloſe Conſideration; It is obſerv'd in Nature, that ſorrow and ſadneſs encline to Wiſdom, and attentneſs of Mind; <hi>Vexation gives underſtanding,</hi> is a ſaying: And hereunto the wiſe King <hi>Solomon</hi> agrees,<note place="margin">Eccleſ. 7.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>

                     <hi>ſorrow is better than laughter. It is better to go to the houſe of Mourning, than to the houſe of Feasting; for the Living will lay it to Heart. And by the ſadneſs of the Countenance, the Heart is made better.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now becauſe of the Order, that God hath plac'd ſorrow in to all theſe great Effects; therefore our Lord pronounc'd a Bleſſing upon <hi>Weeping,</hi> and <hi>Mourning.</hi> For elſe he loves our Joy, when it is Spiritual; he commands to <hi>Rejoyce in the Lord all way;</hi> and again he <hi>ſays, Rejoyce:</hi> He ſpoke many great things,<note place="margin">John 15.11.</note> that <hi>our Joy might be full;</hi> that he might fill our <hi>Mouths with Laughter,</hi> and our <hi>Tongues with Singing.</hi> But our carnal, our ſenſual Joys, he knows, are our Death, and Deſtruction; he knows we are in no better caſe in our prophane, fooliſh, ſinful Laughter, than they who are ſtung with the <hi>Taran<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tula,</hi> and Dye Laughing: Thus we have greateſt reaſon in the <hi>midſt of ſuch Laughter</hi> to be <hi>Sorrowful,</hi> and the <hi>end of that Mirth will be heavineſs:</hi> Thus it will be <hi>bitterneſs</hi> in the <hi>latter end,</hi> therefore he warns us of it before, and in greateſt Love to us, declares a <hi>Woe</hi> on ſuch <hi>Laughter.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. The ſervice of <hi>ſorrow after God</hi> to <hi>Repentance unto Salvation,</hi> is, that it breaks, and forces a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſunder that ſinful Frame in our Hearts, of ſin, and contrariety to God, and to Holyneſs: The very Natural Affection of ſorrow looſens, and Divides the Heart, from that which is the Cauſe and occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of ſuch ſorrow: Becauſe that great Self-love, the force of that Law of Self-preſervation is ſo ſtrong upon us; that ſeeing ſorrow is an Affection, that ſtands in an enmity to our Peace, Comfort, and Enjoyment, and to our Life it ſelf; if it be extreme, or too long continuing; we therefore come off from what is the occaſion, or that gives reaſon to our ſorrow; though we had exceedingly lov'd it before. This we find in all Caſes, and through the whole Nature of Things; when there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore ſin, and loſs of the favour of God becauſe of it, is made by the grace of God the juſt Reaſon, and moſt ſenſible, and prevailing reaſon of our ſor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row; It diſſolves the Frame of ſin in our Heart, that had been before compact, as the Adamant, and as the <hi>neither Mill-ſtone;</hi> Now this ſorrow divi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding, and ſeparating between ſin, and the Soul; it brings forth that <hi>broken</hi> and <hi>contrite Heart,</hi> that <hi>God will not deſpiſe.</hi>

                  <p>Hereupon the <hi>Apoſtle James</hi> preſſes to a great <hi>Mourning after God,</hi> or exerciſe of <hi>Godly ſorrow,</hi> James 4.8. <hi>Draw nigh to God, and he will draw nigh to you; cleanſe your hands you ſinners, purify your hearts you double minded:</hi> How ſhould this great Self-Purification be Effected?

And it ariſes from that Love, and Compaſſion, that is ſeated towards our ſelves in our own Natures, which, when it is by the Hand of Grace pointed aright; It is made a mighty Inſtrument, a mighty Efficacy for Converſion, and Repentance; becauſe when our great Diſguſt, our Sorrow and Self-Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fliction is pitch'd upon ſin, we caſt it off, as that, which is the reaſon of our ſorrow; and that ſtands in our Eye, as hateful, loathſome filth, and impu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, that we can by no means endure; and therefore we ſay to it, <hi>get ye hence,</hi> Oh! you Foul and abominable Luſts, <hi>what have I any more to do with you?</hi>

For <hi>this very ſelf ſame thing, that ye ſorrowed after a Godly ſort; what carefulneſs it wrought in you,</hi> how great is the care and ſollicitude it works in all, that ſo ſorrow, to get out of their Sins, and to return home to God? What <hi>Apology</hi> for <hi>Holyneſs,</hi> for <hi>God,</hi> and againſt <hi>Sin?</hi> what <hi>Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment</hi> againſt ſin? What <hi>Fear</hi> and <hi>Awe</hi> of God ſtriking to the very Heart of ſin? what vehement deſire after God, after true Grace, and perfect Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation? and this boyling up to <hi>Zeal,</hi> or the heigth of Deſire; that Powerful Religious Affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, under the Operation of which a Man cannot <hi>bear Evil,</hi> no, not for a moment. And laſtly, there is an <hi>holy Revenge</hi> upon ſin, <hi>Sathan,</hi> luſt, even a man's ſinful ſelf; by which the Irreconcilable Hatred to every ſin is Diſcovered, and a Monument of that Hatred ſet up in the Soul.</p>
                  <p>Thus works <hi>godly ſorrow to Repentance;</hi> but the <hi>forrow of the World</hi> having nothing to do with God, with ſenſe of his Diſpleaſure for ſin, with ſin, as ſo great a reaſon of ſorrow and trouble; the Spirit re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mains in all its former Frame of union to the world, and to ſin; and ſo with the whole ſtate of ſin, and of the World, and of ſorrow, it ſinks down to the center, to the place of ſorrow for ever; For when ſorrow that is the Inſtrument of God in working <hi>Repentance,</hi> does not prevail to that God's end; it more certainly ſinks down to its Center, and that with great Violence; as we ſee in thoſe fore-nam'd Examples of <hi>Cain, Eſau, Saul, Akito<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phel, Judas,</hi> who not <hi>ſorrowing to Repentance</hi> went
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99379:42"/> down with greater violence to the <hi>Chambers of Death</hi> and <hi>Sorrow,</hi> even everlaſting ſorrow.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. The efficacy of <hi>godly ſorrow to Repnntance,</hi> is, that it makes the Soul very humble before God; the natural effect of ſorrow is to meeken, and bow the Spirit; <hi>heavineſs in the Heart of Man makes it stoop, Prov.</hi> 12.25 the guiſe and mein, or Poſture of ſorrow, is to <hi>bow down the head like a Bull-ruſh.</hi> The <hi>Hipocritical</hi> mourner does ſo, to imitate true ſorrow, <hi>Eſay.</hi> 58.5.

                  <p>But the <hi>ſorrow of the World,</hi> not eying God, nor having regard to him, never changes the Heart, nor Life into obedience to him; and ſo leaves a man in the ſame loſt undone ſtate; and ſo becomes <hi>deſperate Sorrow</hi> and <hi>Anguiſh,</hi> as the Scripture calls it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 8.22. and may be moſt fitly deſcribed by <hi>Jer.</hi> c. 4.28. <hi>They are all greivous Revolters; they are Braſs and Iron; they are all Corrupters; the Bellows are burnt, the Lead is conſumed of the Fire; the Founder melteth in vain; for the Evil of the Heart is not pulled away; reprobate ſilver ſhall men call them, becauſe the Lord hath rejected them.</hi> When God therefore, as the great <hi>Founder,</hi> Caſting men as in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the <hi>Furnace</hi> of ſorrow, they are not purged f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  <p n="1">1. There can be, according to what the Apoſtle ſays, no other object of Rational, Intellectual Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row, but only the loſs of the Favour of God, or his diſpleaſure for ſin, or ſubordinated to it; which makes it <hi>ſorrow after God.</hi> For if on one ſide the ſorrow ſo plac'd, and fix'd, hath ſo bleſſed Effects, that he that ſo ſorrows, receives no iniury by it, but ſo great good, <hi>as Repentance to Salvati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, never to be Repented of;</hi> that it is not ſo much Loſt, as chang'd into <hi>Fulneſs of Joy,</hi> and ſo per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fected; and on the other ſide, that ſorrow laid out on any other object, (which is <hi>ſorrow after the World) works Death:</hi> Then it muſt needs become the wiſe, and gracious God, <hi>of whom, by whom are all things in bringing many Sons to Glory, to bring them to Perfection,</hi> by ſuch a ſorrow as this.</p>
                  <pb n="50" facs="tcp:99379:44"/>
                  <p>For if God was pleas'd to make ſuch a Rational, Intellectual Nature, as man, that might, though made Holy, fall into ſin; It muſt needs be, that it muſt have a fitneſs to turn it ſelf with ſorrow up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on ſuch an evil, and reaſon of ſorrow, as God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended and diſpleas'd for ſin; ſuppoſing a man, by that ſin had not loſt either the uſe of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, or not loſt the ſenſe of God, Holineſs, and Goodneſs; ſeeing if it did not lye Dead, and Benummed, or ſtrongly diverted and turned off from its Object; or that God does not appear an Irre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>concileable Judg, and Revenger, and give up man to the wickedneſs and rage of Death. It muſt ſo turn.</p>
                  <p>Whenever therefore God by his grace in Chriſt, and by his Spirit, turns any ſinner to himſelf, and ſtirs up thoſe Powers of underſtanding, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcience after himſelf; The very order of the Cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ation of God Requires, that the underſtanding and Natural Conſcience, and Affection of Man ſhould be turn'd upon him, diſpleas'd by Sin, by this hum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble ſorrow of Love; even as upon his wrath, and Vengeance, with a ſorrow of Pain, Fear, and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror; ſo that both the <hi>Bondage of Fear of Death,</hi>

                  <p>On the other ſide, if the turn of the Rational Nature, and Affection, be drawn out upon the ſenſe of any evil with trouble, and diſlike, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flection on its diſagreeableneſs and inconveniency, and yet its preſſure upon it; which is ſorrow, grief, and ſadneſs; it muſt either be turn'd upon God of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fended, and diſpleas'd by ſin; or it is to no pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:99379:44"/> of good, that there is ſuch a Paſſion or Af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection in man: For if it be plac'd on any other object, it is but ſorrow of this World, how juſt ſo ever, in regard of any evil of ſuffering, it may ſeem to be: It is but <hi>ſorrow to Death,</hi> and ſo of no good at all to us, but evil, till it be deriv'd into a higher and more excellent Channel: So that it may be ſaid of this <hi>ſorrow,</hi> as <hi>Solomon</hi> ſays of <hi>Laughter.

                     <note place="margin">Mark 9.43.</note> 
                     <hi>and the Right Foot, a pulling out the Right Eye, a true Spiritual being put to Death, a ſlay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, a crucifying our ſelves in the Fleſh,</hi> that we may <hi>Live to God in the Spirit; a ſuffering the Spirit of

                  </p>
                  <p>Now All theſe Things are of great uſe, as they are Acknowledgments of the Righteous Judgment of God, due to us in our Eternal Condemnation, as they are Judging our ſelves to the very Fire of Hell; As they declare the exceeding Evil of Sin, and the Foulneſs of it; as they ſhew us the abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Neceſſity of a Redeemer; as they lay a Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation of ſeparating our ſelves from ſin, and of the utter Hatred of it. And laſtly, They are ſuch, as muſt needs reſult from Rational Nature, endued with moſt powerful Principles of the Law of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs, Knowledge of God, and of his Righte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Judgment, written in the <hi>Hearts</hi> and the <hi>Thoughts</hi> he hath made; the Conſcience he hath created, either for <hi>Accuſing</hi> or <hi>Excuſing;</hi> and eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially all theſe mightily ſet home by the power of the Spirit of God; that ſo he may have, though not <hi>Real Satisfaction</hi> from the <hi>Sinner;</hi> for that is <hi>a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lone from Chriſt;</hi> Yet ſuch an <hi>Honorary ſatisfaction,</hi> and <hi>Acknowledgment;</hi> as is due from a ſinner, even in his very Soul, and from the bottom of his Heart; in the <hi>Day,</hi> wherein rhe Lord is <hi>pacified towards him,</hi> that <hi>flies for Refuge to the hope ſet before him.</hi>

                     <hi>Particular</hi> 2. The <hi>ſecond Particular</hi> in this Head, concerning <hi>Repentance,</hi> in the <hi>strict conſideration</hi> of it, is, <hi>That it imports very cloſe and particular Negoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ationn, and Tranſactions with God, in relation to For<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giveneſs; and ſuch, as expreſs our particular ſhame, and ſorrow, that we have offended him; and earneſt Deſires, that he would ſhew us, that he is at peace
<pb n="63" facs="tcp:99379:50"/> with us, and hath pardon'd all that is paſs'd in Christ.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Under this I will Diſcourſe theſe following Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culars:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. In <hi>Repentance:</hi> The Humble, Repenting Soul caſts it ſelf down in the moſt lowly, and Self-aba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing Acknowledgment of ſin, and confeſſion of it. Scripture therefore points ſo much at <hi>Confeſſion: He that confeſſeth, and forſaketh:</hi> He muſt firſt <hi>confeſs,</hi> and then <hi>forſake his ſins,</hi> and <hi>he ſhall find mercy,</hi> Prov. 28.13. And <hi>David</hi> deſcribes a <hi>Penitent,</hi> as one, <hi>in whoſe Spirit there is no guile:</hi> that is, he makes an open, ſincere, hearty Confeſſion. This is one Branch of the Deſcription of the <hi>Bleſled Man, whoſe Iniquities are forgiven, and whoſe ſins are co<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vered;</hi> and to whom <hi>the Lord will not impute Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty:</hi> And after, it follows, <hi>I acknowledg'd my Iniqui<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty unto thee, and my ſin have I not hid: I ſaid, I will confeſs my tranſgreſſion unto the Lord, and thou forga<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veſt the Iniquity rf my ſ n.</hi> But before I did this, and while <hi>I kept ſilence, thy hand was heavy upon me;</hi> ſo that <hi>my moiſture was tu ned inio the drought of ſummer,</hi> Pſalm 32.1, <hi>&amp;c. I acknowledge my tnanſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſſion, and my ſin is ever before me,</hi> Pſalm 51.3. <hi>Ezra thus made confeſſion,</hi> c. 9. So <hi>Nehemiah.</hi> c. 9. So <hi>Daniel,</hi> c. 9. And the Apoſtle, <hi>John,</hi> Ep. 1. c. 1.9. ſays, <hi>If we confeſs our ſins he is f<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ithful and juſt to forgive us our ſins, and to cleanſe us from all un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>righteouſneſs.</hi> Thus we ſee how much Scripture puts upon <hi>Confeſſion</hi> throughout.</p>
                  <p>Now <hi>Confeſſion of ſin</hi> is not accepted of God for it ſelf: For what can we ſuppoſe, the Relation of
<pb n="64" facs="tcp:99379:51"/> our ſins can be to God, the <hi>Eyes</hi> of whoſe <hi>Holineſs,</hi> and <hi>Glory,</hi> are ſo <hi>p<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                           <desc>•</desc>
                        </gap>ovok'd</hi> by our ſins? But he hath only Regard to us, that we ſhould in hatred of our ſins, and of our ſinful ſelves, expoſe them with ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred, and abhorrence of our ſelves; and becauſe we are reſolved to have no more to do with them, we diſcover and detect them, without any thing of <hi>Guile,</hi> without any <hi>Reſerve:</hi> For, as the Expreſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion is in <hi>Job,</hi> when we <hi>ſpare our ſins,</hi> we <hi>roll them under our Tongues.</hi> The more therefore we con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſs them with trouble of Mind, and in bitterneſs of Spirit, and with Reſolutions of having no more to do with them, the more acceptable is our Confeſſion to God; becauſe thereby our Confeſſion the more attains God's Ends, and what he is moſt pleas'd with in our Confeſſion. For therein is our ſincerity, when we confeſs ſin, becauſe it is Reaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to expect we will not be reconcil'd to the ſins we confeſs: For that is for <hi>the Dog to return to his Vomit.</hi> Confeſſion of our ſins, with Loathing and Abhorrence, is <hi>vomiting them out of our mouths.</hi> And sherefore to <hi>return to them again,</hi> is to return to our <hi>Vomit:</hi> and Confeſſion is like Waſhing and Purify<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing our ſelves: To retturn therefore to the ſins we have confeſs'd is <hi>wallowing our ſelves in the mire,</hi> af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter <hi>waſhing.</hi> This ſeems ſo Reaſonable, and even Neceſſary, that when it is firſt ſaid, <hi>He that hideth and covereth his ſins, ſhall not proſper:</hi> Then, he that <hi>confeſſeth, and forſaketh, ſhall find mercy.</hi> It is ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, if any Man does not <hi>confeſs,</hi> he will not <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſake;</hi> but if he confeſſes, he does it in order to <hi>for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſaking.</hi> But yet becauſe Men are ſo apt to deceive themſelves with Formality, and to think, God may be ſo put off, and pleas'd, he adds; He that not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly
<pb n="65" facs="tcp:99379:51"/> 
                     <hi>confeſleth,</hi> but does that which is ſo neceſſary with Confeſſion <hi>forſakes; ſhall find mercy.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Thus <hi>Solomon,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 <hi>Kings</hi> 8.</note> all along his Pray<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er, joyns many Expreſſions, that are the undoubted Acts of <hi>ſincere Repentance,</hi> to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether with the <hi>Confeſſion of ſin.</hi> And if Confeſſion be thus joyn'd with Sorrow, Shame, Trouble, Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tred of ſins and utter ſeparation from them; it could not deſervedly fall under that Ridicule, and Contempt, that prophane men put upon it; as if it were the telling God only the Story of our wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Hearts, or Lives: But without other ſincere, effective Powers of Repentance, it too juſtly <hi>falls under that Reproach;</hi> but any ſuch <hi>Reproach, our Lord will return upon us, and our Confeſſion.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. In <hi>Repentance</hi> there is an earneſt and moſt ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hement, but alſo moſt humble Application to the <hi>Throne of Grace,</hi> in Jeſus Chriſt, for Pardon and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>conciliation; and with ſuch a Continuance and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeverance, as till there be ſome Anſwer, that God is our Gracious Father in Chriſt; that we hear the <hi>Joyful ſound,</hi> that <hi>our ſins are forgiven us.</hi> It is not only that <hi>common</hi> and <hi>formal way of asking Pardon,</hi> whether we mind it or not; but to make it our Bu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſineſs, the Aim and Deſign of our Souls, till we re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive ſome gracious aſſurance, that our Deſires are anſwered, and our Prayers heard.

                  <p n="1">1. In that it is <hi>Repentance to Salvation,</hi> wrought by a <hi>ſorrow after God;</hi> it is ordain'd by God, as a ſecurity, and preſervative by his eſpecial Grace in Chriſt from everlaſting <hi>Weeping, Wailing, and gnaſhing of Teeth:</hi> a Repentance without any Fruit, or Effect, but a continual Circulation of it ſelf in Horrors, and fruitleſs renewals, without eaſe, or remedy, without poſſibility of Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, of recovery to God, and Holineſs; For in Hell there is no ſuch: <hi>Woe therefore to you that Laugh now,</hi> without this true Repentance; For you ſhall weep, and weep for ever; it is the ſtate of <hi>utter Darkneſs, extremity of Darkneſs,</hi> and to extremity of Duration, even <hi>Eternal Duration:</hi> But true Repentance hath had its Proportion here <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 word">

                  <p n="2">2. It is not only a ſecurity from Damnation, but an aſſurance of a ſtate of Life, Glory, and Bleſſedneſs; For upon this very reaſon, becauſe
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99379:62"/> God hath Sanctified Repentance to Difference, and ſeparate his Servants by, from all the loſt, and periſhing, Repentance is ſo eminently call'd <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance unto Salvation;</hi> and <hi>Repentance unto Life:</hi> For when the miſerable, and undone ſhall com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plain, and endeavour to Impeach the Divine Juſtice, with the Salvation of Sinners, as great, or greater than themſelves, <hi>Publicans</hi> and <hi>Harlots,</hi> ſuch as the Apoſtle ſpeaks of, 1 Cor. 6.</p>
                  <p>When many ſober moral Men, both Heathens, Jews, and Chriſtians are <hi>ſhut out</hi> from Heaven, Salvation, Life,<note place="margin">Matt. 8.11.</note> and Happineſs; and fall into the <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of Hell;</hi> God juſtifies and Vindicates him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf by the vaſt Diſtance between the one, and the other, Repentance hath made; which, as it ſhould engage our Thoughts in deep ſearch, what kind of Repentance we have, whether it can make ſuch a Difference; ſo it aſſures us, there is a great excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency and Dignity in true Repentance; when it ſhall be ſeen in the Glory of the Righteouſneſs of Chriſt, wherein it ſhall be diſplay'd, as in its chief Light, Life, and Luſtre.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There ſhall never be any cauſe, the leaſt cauſe to look back with ſorrow, or regret, that we loſt any of the pleaſures of Senſe, or of this World; or that we paſs'd through the Severities, or Ri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gors or Sadneſs of Repentance, or that <hi>ſorrow after God,</hi> by which it was wrought: And which ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſes the Bleſſedneſs and Grace of this Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance much more; we ſhall not look back upon any of the Imperfections, and impure Allays of it, the Vacuities, and Emptineſſes of it, that were
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99379:63"/> not fill'd up now. For it ſhall, in every regard be filled up to the Higheſt Complement of Perfection. becauſe it is ſurrounded with the Righteouſneſs of Jeſus Chriſt, and Adorn'd with its Rays, and Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fections; and the mighty Operations of the Spirit of Chriſt, holds them faſt in that very moment wherein his ſervants go out of this World; <hi>He apprehends them,</hi> he holds them in his mighty Hand, and Arm, to perfect them to the <hi>Mark,</hi> both in their Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and in all other Graces.</p>

                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Sorrow for ſin, and Repentance are by no means to be look'd upon as ſeparate from the Blood and Redemption of the Lord Jeſus; but as flowing from it, and <hi>Ordain'd by God, in the hand of the Mediator;</hi> who truly gives it, <hi>waſhes it in his own Blood,</hi> and as the <hi>great High Prieſt,</hi> Offers it with the <hi>Incenſe, Oyntments,</hi> and <hi>rich Perfumes</hi> of his own Holineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Purity.

He had ſomething elſe to do, when he was thus humbling himſelf before God, and beſeeching mercy, than to Magnify himſelf above his fellow Creatures: He was laying faſt hold of Infinite Power, and Grace, and Pardon; and from which there was no Appeal: For unto thee <hi>Lord, belongs Mercy</hi> uncontrollable, who haſt the Ultimate Judicature of <hi>Rendring</hi> to the <hi>Treſpaſſor,</hi> and <hi>Treſpaſſed according to their Works.</hi>

He is not Looſe, or Prodigal in his Forgiveneſs, but hath provided this Admirable Grace, and Duty of Repentance, to ſhew; that as he does not cut off Awes of him, and Reverential Returns to him, by offering no Mercy, but giving up to Deſpair; ſo he does not turn Wild the Hearts, and Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſciences of them, whom he Pardons, by Licentious Forgiveneſs, but ſo ſtated, and bounded that <hi>his Grace may not be turn'd to Wantonneſs.</hi>

                  <p>There is a fixed ſpace given, and a peculiar Interval Appointed: Lying between the time of the <hi>Apoſtacy,</hi> call'd, <hi>the Time, Times, and Half Time,</hi> or the 1260 Days, and the Time of the Vials.

                  </p>
                  <p>Now becauſe this is a point of great moment to the Doctrine of Repentance, and ſets forth much of the Excellency of Repentance: I ſhall give very great Scriptures, and argue upon them for the truth of ir.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Scripture</hi> 1. The firſt Scripture I would inſiſt upon, ſhall be from a conſideration of that great Ordinance of God concerning <hi>the Day of Attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment among the Children of</hi> Iſrael: <hi>This Ordinance We find,</hi> Levit. 23.27. <hi>In the tenth day of the ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>venth, the Sabbattical Month, there ſhall be a day of attonement: It ſhall be an Holy Convocation to you: and you ſhall afflict your Souls: And you ſhall do no work in that ſame day: For it is a day of Attonement to make Attonement for you before the Lord your God: for whatſoever Soul it be, that ſhall not be afflicted in that ſame Day, he ſhall be cut off from among his People: And whatſoever Soul it be that doth any work in that ſame day, the ſame Soul will I deſtroy from
<pb n="100" facs="tcp:99379:69"/> among his People: It ſhall be a ſtatute for ever through<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out your Generations in all your Dwellings: It ſhall be to you a Sabbath of Reſt, and you ſhall Afflict your Souls.</hi> And on that day there were the great rites of <hi>Sacrifice;</hi> the <hi>Bullock,</hi> the ſin Offering; the Blood of which was carried into the Holy of Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, to make an attonement for the <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſſes</hi> of the <hi>Priests</hi> and <hi>People,</hi> and to reconcile the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holies,</hi> and the <hi>Mercy Seat,</hi> and the <hi>Ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hernacle</hi> of <hi>the Congregation,</hi> and the <hi>Goat</hi> that was to be Kill'ed in the ſame Manner; and the <hi>ſcape-Goat,</hi> throughout c, 16.</p>
                  <p>Now that which I lay in the Foundation, is, That God never appointed any of theſe great Rites, but they had a Solemn ſignification; a ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nification, as ſollemn, as the <hi>Type</hi> was: So that there muſt be ſome great ſenſe of this <hi>day of attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment;</hi> I know it had a great fulfilling in Chriſt; and in him, as an <hi>Offering once for all,</hi> that imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately <hi>Entred into the Holy of Holies,</hi> with his <hi>own Blood to appear in Heaven for us,</hi> It had very great parts of its accompliſhment: But there are other great Parts that are to be fulfill'd in his Saints and for them, as in themſelves: And eſpecially in this ſolemn <hi>Affliction:</hi> So that as if any did not <hi>afflict their Souls,</hi> they were to <hi>be cut off</hi> ſo now.</p>
                  <p>And in theſe things, this day had many very remarkable Lines of the ſollemn <hi>affliction</hi> and <hi>attone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,</hi> that ſhall be in the very laſt parts of Time, and near the ſtate of <hi>the Kingdom of Chriſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was an <hi>Ordinance throughout the Generations</hi> of both Natural, and Adopted <hi>Iſrael.</hi> A <hi>Statute for ever,</hi> that is, until the very <hi>Kingdom of Christ.</hi>

                  <p n="4">4. That peculiar <hi>Sacrifical</hi> Rite of the <hi>Scape Goat</hi> on this day ſent <hi>away into the Wilderneſs,</hi> was a moſt lively ſignification of the final act of Obli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vion, and act of <hi>Amneſty upon all ſin,</hi> and the <hi>Curſe</hi> for it born away into the <hi>Land of Forgetfulneſs,</hi> and ſo perfect <hi>attonement</hi> made, and all former Evils of the Curſe Forgotten, <hi>Eſay</hi> 65.16, 17.</p>

A Third Great Scripture I inſiſt upon, is, <hi>Zech.</hi> 12 12. <hi>In that Day there ſhall be a great mourning in Jeruſalem, as the mourning of Hadadrim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon, in the Valley of Megiddo:</hi> And <hi>the Land ſhall mourn, every Family apart, and the Families that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>main, apart.</hi> This <hi>Prophecy</hi> is moſt apparently, by all that went before, and follows after, a <hi>Prophecy of the Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> and for that <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> there is ſo great a <hi>mourning,</hi> as in preparati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to it; There ſhall be a <hi>Spirit of Grace</hi> and <hi>Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plication;</hi>
                     <pb n="103" facs="tcp:99379:70"/> an admirable univerſal Grace of Repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, in all parts of Repentance, <hi>poured out upon the Iſrael of God in Jeruſalem, looking on him whom they have peirc'd,</hi> and ſo long Rejected; and a joynt mourning of Convert-<hi>Gentiles,</hi> repreſented by the <hi>Mourning of Hadad-Rimmon,</hi> or of the very glory of <hi>Aſſyria;</hi> known by the name of their God <hi>Rimmon,</hi> and their Dedication to his Glory; this Mourning of the Gentiles ſhall be in <hi>Megiddo,</hi> as in <hi>Iſrael</hi> for all their Idolatries, and <hi>Crucifying of Chriſt in his Witneſſes</hi> ſlain in <hi>Spiritual Egypt;</hi> of which that excellent Prince <hi>Joſiah</hi> ſlain in the Cauſe of <hi>Aſſyria,</hi> by <hi>Pharoah King of Egypt</hi> was a Type, and ſo <hi>lamented</hi> by both <hi>Iſrael,</hi> and <hi>Aſſyria: Iſraelites</hi> by Nature, and Adoptive <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in that great <hi>day</hi> ſhall <hi>mourn;</hi> and it ſhall be ſo deep, and ſincere that all <hi>Families</hi> ſhall Mourn, not only together, but apart: They ſhall not Mourn for ſhew, form, and Company, or need that Natural Excitation of Mourning, the ſeeing one another Mourn; but they ſhall <hi>Mourn apart.</hi> The <hi>Royal Family, ſignified by the Houſe of David;</hi> the <hi>Prophetick Families,</hi> ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied by the <hi>Houſe of Nathan;</hi> the <hi>Prieſtly Family</hi> ſignified by the <hi>Houſe of Levi,</hi> and <hi>Scribal Families</hi> ſignified by the <hi>Houſe of Shimei;</hi> and the converted <hi>Gentiles,</hi> ſignified by the <hi>Families that remain;</hi> the uſual Character for the <hi>Heathen Nations:</hi> Becauſe <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in God's account, is the principal; The <hi>Remnant,</hi> whom the <hi>Lord our God ſhall call,</hi> Joel c. 2.31. and the <hi>Reſidue of Men,</hi> even all the <hi>Gen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiles,</hi> as the Apoſtle <hi>James,</hi> Acts 15.17. interprets, <hi>Amos</hi> 9.11.</p>
                  <p>Now in this Day of the great <hi>mourning, and affli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cting the Soul, this Day of attonement,</hi> there ſhall be
<pb n="104" facs="tcp:99379:71"/> 
                     <hi>an opening the Fountain for Sin, and for <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>ncleanneſs;</hi> for <hi>the waſhing of the Robes of all Saints, and ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king them white in the Blood of the Lamb:</hi> that as it is <hi>granted to them,</hi> they may be arrayed in <hi>Linen white and clean;</hi> which is the <hi>Righteouſneſs of the Saints,</hi> Rev. 7.14. c. 19.8.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The laſt Scripture, wherein I will draw up, and ſum this Point, is <hi>Revelations</hi> 14.6. <hi>I ſaw another Angel fly in the midſt of heaven; having the everlaſting Goſpel to preach to all,</hi> &amp;c. ſay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, <hi>Fear God, and give glooy to him,</hi> by Confeſſion, Humiliation, and Repentance. At which time the <hi>Gentiles ſhall come from the ends of the Earth,</hi> and ſay, <hi>Our Fathers have inherited Lies,</hi> and things, <hi>wherein there is no profit:</hi> Shall <hi>a man make himſelf Gods of them who are no Gods;</hi> who have not made the <hi>Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vens, nor the Earth, the Sea, nor the Fountains of Wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter.</hi> This ſhall be when God this once (that once, when he is juſt ready to <hi>ſhake Heaven and Earth</hi>) and <hi>this once</hi> ſignifies the doing it ſo, that it ſhall ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ver need to be done any more; and they ſhall know that his Name is <hi>Jehovah;</hi> that <hi>he is the true God,</hi> and <hi>all other Gods ſhall periſh from the Earth, and from under theſe Heavens,</hi> Jerem. 10.11. c. 16.19, 20, 21.</p>
                  <p>Thus, as at the firſt preaching of the Goſpel, there were ſo great Converſions, <hi>prickings in the heart,</hi> and Repentances, <hi>Acts</hi> 2, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Becauſe that was the <hi>fullneſs of time:</hi> So there ſhall be much greater, when the <hi>fullneſs of times,</hi> eve<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

<pb n="105" facs="tcp:99379:71"/> of all time: For That Goſpel, that was alway the everlaſting Goſpel, ſhall then appear in that ſtile, and be known by it. The <hi>everlaſting Goſpel,</hi> and therefore its Force, Effect, and Succeſs, ſhall be much greater than ever.</p>
                  <p>And it immediately follows upon this Preaching the <hi>Everlasting Goſpel, another Angel proclaim'd with a loud Voice; Babilon is fallen, is fallen;</hi> before this it could not be done. The Church of <hi>

                  <p>Now how does this Recommend to us the Doctrine of Repentance <hi>throughout all our Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions,</hi> and through the whole courſe of our Lives, ſeeing the World <hi>of the Sav'd</hi> ſhall be thus <hi>Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſed</hi> with the <hi>Baptiſm</hi> of <hi>Repentance</hi> for the <hi>Remiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion of Sins,</hi> juſt before <hi>Salvation.</hi>

                  <p>And into this Treaſury, all ages of Saints in the World, before this time, have caſt by <hi>Mourning, God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Sorrow,</hi> and <hi>Repentance:</hi> For have not their <hi>Tears been put into God's Bottle,</hi> and <hi>are they not in his Books?</hi> And at what time are they more likely to be Produced to their Etternal Account, and Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, than in ſuch a day of <hi>Attonement,</hi> and <hi>Reconciliation?</hi> When the days of <hi>Refreſhing,</hi> that <hi>Bleſſed,</hi> and <hi>Happy Age ſhall come forth from the preſence of the Lord,</hi> his immediate Appearance, even the ſame <hi>Appearance</hi> that ſhall utterly aboliſh the <hi>man of ſin,</hi> 2 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 2.8. and revive and re-enliven the Saints, that have <hi>Dyed and Slept in Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus,</hi> into the <hi>Firſt Reſurrection,</hi> upon whom <hi>Bleſſed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> is then Proclaim'd; when <hi>all ſins ſhall be perfect<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly blotted out,</hi> and their <hi>holy Works</hi> alone ſhall <hi>follow them</hi> (among which <hi>Repentance</hi> is one of the Prin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipal) in the <hi>Day of the Reſtitution of all things,</hi> in the <hi>day of Salvation</hi> when it ſhall appear, true <hi>Evangelical Repentance</hi> is never to be <hi>Repented of,</hi> Acts 3.19, 21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 14.13.</p>
                  <p>And to move us therefore all, and to <hi>provoke us</hi> to either the firſt Repentance, if we have not yet Repented; or to Renewed and advanced Repentance;<note place="margin">Rom. 13.12.</note> let us con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider, how far the <hi>Night</hi> of the Apoſtaſy is paſs'd, and the <hi>Day of Salvation is at hand?</hi> How very near it grows?

                  <p>
                     <hi>Infer.</hi> 8. Becauſe, I know, there is ſo great an unwillingneſs to believe ſuch an Approach of the Kingdom of Chriſt; Let us take, as we ſtand in the National Community, whereof we are, this great Doctrine of Repentance into deepeſt and cloſeſt conſideration. For we find Scripture, when<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever it ſpeaks to a Community, as to the Kingdom of <hi>Judah,</hi> and <hi>Iſrael,</hi> in the <hi>Prophets</hi> it ſtill ſpeaks to them, as ſuch Communities, as in the Language, and Doctrine of Repentance; and when it ſpeaks to the Churches, as in the ſecond and third Chap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters of the <hi>Revelation,</hi> it ſpeaks to them as ſuch Communities, and commands them to <hi>Repent,</hi> as was before obſerv'd.</p>
                  <p>How neceſſary therefore to the National Body is the Doctrine of Repentance, taken as relating to a Community? How neceſſary muſt it needs be to every one of us, not only as for our own Immor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tal Souls, but as Parts and Members of the Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>onal Community, and to the Church, or Church<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es of this Nation; that of the <hi>Church</hi> of <hi>England,</hi> or the <hi>National Church,</hi> as ſo, many love to ſpeak? or to the <hi>Churches,</hi> that are in <hi>England,</hi> or <hi>Churches of England;</hi> as others agreeably enough with Scripture, ſpeak as of the <hi>Churches of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dea;</hi> of <hi>Galatia;</hi> and thus undoubtedly there is a truth in both ways of ſpeaking.</p>
                  <p>For when God hath given a Nation an univer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſal conſent in the Profeſſion of the Name of God, of Chriſt, and of the Goſpel, they do in many great Regards, and Accounts of Scripture, come
<pb n="108" facs="tcp:99379:73"/> under ſuch an Obligatory repreſentation, as a <hi>Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional Church;</hi> as <hi>Judah</hi> and <hi>Iſrael</hi> in the times of the <hi>Old Teſtament</hi> came under. And all particu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lar <hi>Churches,</hi> wherein ſo ever they differ in many particulars, and make diſtinct Aſſociations of them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves, may be look'd upon, as particular <hi>Churches;</hi> and ſo Scripture vouches for them; becauſe they do in a Particular Union <hi>give themſelves to the Lord, and to one another;</hi> yet notwithſtanding, they cannot, what ever they may think, put off their Relation to the whole Nation, whereto they are United as parts; nor to it, as United with them, in the ſubſtantial Eſſential Points of Chriſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>anity, not ſo Adulterated, but that ſuch Church is look'd upon as a true Church, by God, and by Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>Nor can the more general or National Church Diſ-intereſt it ſelf in any of the more particular and <hi>Diſſenting Churches;</hi> ſeeing in God's account they are within it; even thoſe that are pureſt, and have moſt of the Spirit, and Power of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, and truly Purer than it ſelf, as in the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral; as the more general <hi>Church of Sardis</hi> had within it ſelf, <hi>the few purer Names</hi> that had not <hi>Defiled their Garments.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rev. 3.1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> This is when a more general Church is pure in ſubſtantials of Doctrine, Worſhip, and Laws of Holy Converſation; it is otherwiſe when what is call'd a <hi>Church,</hi> is <hi>Anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chriſtian</hi> and <hi>Idolatrous</hi> in its ſubſtantials; as in thoſe of the <hi>Papacy;</hi> and have no more Right to the Name of a <hi>Church,</hi> than that Idolatrous aſſembly, that <hi>cried up</hi> Diana <hi>of the</hi> Epheſians, <hi>Acts</hi> 19. though it be there call'd by the ſame Name
<pb n="109" facs="tcp:99379:73"/> of a <hi>Church,</hi> or <hi>Eccleſia,</hi> that the <hi>Churches</hi> of the Saints are. <hi>v.</hi> 32.41.</p>
                  <p>Now this I have Premiſ'd, to ſhew, how neceſſary the Doctrine of Repentance is to be Of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, and to be Receiv'd by the generality of the <hi>Church, Churches,</hi> and <hi>People</hi> of this Nation; ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to the Doctrine of both the <hi>New</hi> and <hi>Old Teſtament,</hi> even that Repentance that hath been Diſcours'd; the <hi>Repentance to Salvation, never to be Repented of,</hi> and to be wrought by a <hi>Godly ſorrow,</hi> or a <hi>ſorrow after God.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may look like a Difficulty; how a Nation Compoſed of ſuch Variety of leſſer, and diſtinct Communities, one from another; and much more ſo many ſingle perſons, ſhould be brought to Unite in Repentance; or a Church, that hath ſo many leſſer, and different Churches; or, How ſuch a Repentance can be <hi>a Repentance to Salvation;</hi> ſeeing Nations are not ſo much ſav'd as Nations, but particular Perſons, of thoſe general Commu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nities are the Saved.</p>
                  <p>This may be three ways Reconciled.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By conſidering, there is the Face of a Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on, and of a National Profeſſion of Chriſtianity, in the Princes, Rulers, and Councels of it: and When theſe ſet themſelves to Repentance, of Refor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mation: How greatly neceſſary therefore is it to Repreſent with greateſt Efficacies of Perſwaſion to them the duty to Reform themſelves; and to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amples of the ſame to the Nation: We find therefore Univerſally in Scripture, there is ſo much applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Kings, and Nobles, the Counſellors, and Judges of <hi>Iſrael;</hi> and Remonſtrances againſt their ſins, and not Reforming.</p>
                  <pb n="110" facs="tcp:99379:74"/>
                  <p>And this lies with eſpecial Obligation upon thoſe, who are Exalted into the moſt publick Stations of the Chriſtian Miniſtration; thoſe, who are the moſt publick <hi>Seers.</hi> So we find <hi>Nathan,</hi> the King's <hi>Seer,</hi> was choſen out by God to ſpeak to <hi>David,</hi> in thoſe two great ſervices of ſhewing <hi>David</hi> his ſin, and moving him to Repentance, 2 <hi>Sam.</hi> 12. When he had ſo fallen; God ſent to move him to Repentance by his own <hi>Seer,</hi> or, as I may Expreſs it, <hi>Biſhop.</hi> And ſo in the Caſe of <hi>Numbring the People;</hi> God ſent to <hi>David</hi> by <hi>Gad,</hi> another of his <hi>Seers,</hi> 2 Sam. 24.11.</p>
                  <p>Again, when God declared to <hi>David</hi> the <hi>Building the Temple,</hi> not by himſelf, but by his Son <hi>Solomon;</hi> to encourage his Preparation for it; but to Countermand his Building it; he did it by the ſame <hi>Nathan, his Seer,</hi> 1 Chron. 17.3.</p>
                  <p>And thus when God, by his Providence, Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alts any to a Precedency, or Preſidency in the <hi>Goſpel Ministry,</hi> ſo as to be near Princes, and Councels, and Senates in that high Adminiſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion; when they are Zealous, and Succeſsful in their <hi>Preaching Repentance;</hi> and ſuch <hi>Higher Powers</hi> are mov'd by it: This generally goes down from ſuch <hi>Heads</hi> of a <hi>Nation,</hi> to the <hi>skirts of the Garment,</hi> viz. The ſubordinated Miniſtry of a Nation, and its Magiſtracy, and ſo to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerality of the People: And it becomes in God's gracious acceptance through Chriſt, and Ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count, a <hi>National Repentance,</hi> though there may be many particular Perſons, both in Miniſtry and Magiſtracy negligent of their Duty, and much more many unreformed Perſons among the Multitude.</p>
                  <pb n="111" facs="tcp:99379:74"/>
                  <p>And ſuch Repentance may be called <hi>Repentance to Salvation,</hi> For it does not only, as in the <hi>King of Nineveh's</hi> Caſe, give a Reprieve from preſenr Judgments, and bring in great Bleſſings, and proſperity to a Nation at the preſent; but there is very great Reaſon to believe in the viſible Glory of the <hi>Kingdom of Christ:</hi> There are, as I may ſo ſpeak, Conſtellations of Saints, who have joyn'd together in the ſame Nation, and time in Repentance, and earneſt Endeavours for <hi>Reforma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion;</hi> for, as <hi>Daniel</hi> ſays, <hi>The Wiſe,</hi> and <hi>they that turn many to Righteouſneſs, ſhall ſhine as the Stars,</hi> and as the <hi>brightneſs of the Firmament for ever, and ever,</hi> Dan, 12.3.</p>
                  <p>Now how does the preſent ſtate of the Nation require the joyning of all that fear God, to re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trench that boldneſs, and inſolency of wickedneſs that rages throughout the Nation; and to neceſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tate the Vices and Prophaneſſes of Men, who have no fear of God, to keep within, and not to ſhew themſelves, as they do openly, and abroad! and in the mean time, to give ſuch an Honour to <hi>God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs, Righteouſneſs, and Soberneſs;</hi> that the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trary to theſe may not be charged as National ſins; and therefore herein, thoſe that are principal <hi>Seers</hi> of the Nation, and have opportunity to do it to Princes, and Councels, are under greateſt obligations of Duty, Love, Honour, and Service to God, and our Lord Jeſus Chriſt; to move with light, and Heat in their Orb, and Sphere; to make due remonſtrances of the abſolute neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſity, that there is, to diſcharge the Nation of that great weight of Publick Guilt, that lies upon it by the Enormities; that not being reſtrain'd, and
<pb n="112" facs="tcp:99379:75"/> Puniſh'd, Redoun'd from particular Offenders (whom they have firſt inveſted, and cover'd all over) upon the Community, to which they be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>long; and to incite, and greatly to encourage all whatever denomination, or diſtinction ſoever they are of, to Unite in this; to give a ſtop to the overflowing wickedneſs, that there be not <hi>wrath</hi> againſt the <hi>Royal Family,</hi> the <hi>ſupreme Powers</hi> of the <hi>Nation,</hi> the ſuperior <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> of it; and againſt the whole <hi>Nation;</hi> which <hi>Epiſcopacy</hi> above all, ought to <hi>cry aloud, and not to ſpare,</hi> but to ſhew to the Court and Councels of it, the ſins and tranſgreſſions of the Nation; which they make their own by not turning their whole Power a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gainſt, and to exhort all to joyn <hi>with one ſhoulder</hi> againſt them.</p>
                  <p>For the preſent ſtate ſo Unreformed, ſo Lux<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>urious in Wickedneſs, ſhews, that according to all the word of God, and the general courſe of his Providence, that hath ever been in the world; ſome one of theſe three things muſt needs be.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That there muſt be an Univerſal, National Reformation from thoſe ſins, that being of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick, and ſenſible appearance; ſins that may be felt, and that are ſo palpable to the common ſenſe of <hi>Natural Conſcience,</hi> and ſo cogniſable, and ought to be taken notice of by the Courts of Human Judicature, may be reſtrain'd; and kept from Dying the Nation in ſo Crimſon, and Scarlet a Guilt, ſuch a Purple Hiew by the abominations, now it is, all over ſtain'd with; the horrid Oaths, or Swearing, for the great commonneſs of which,
<pb n="113" facs="tcp:99379:75"/> even on ſeeming better accounts, <hi>Lands mourn ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often;</hi> the noiſe of which bellows in all ſtreets, and publick places, as well as in private Families; the dreadful <hi>Curſings and Dammings</hi> that every where reſound; the <hi>fearful Sabbath-breakings,</hi> that turn it not only into a Day of Idleneſs and ſloath, but of leiſure to all manner of Wickedneſs; the Exceſs of Pride, and Vanity in apparel, which the very Prudence of <hi>ſumptuary Laws</hi> ſhould reform; the Impudence and Outrage of Luſt and Luxury, <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claring,</hi> and not <hi>hiding it ſelf,</hi> as in <hi>Sodom</hi> of Old; the <hi>Great <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nmercifulneſs to the Poor,</hi> of all Kinds, and not <hi>ſtrengthning their hands</hi> to ſuch profitable ſervice, and employment in their Places, as might abound, not only to their own private (which ought to be) but to publick Good.</p>
                  <p>Theſe things, with all Care and Zeal, not only ought, but muſt be reduc'd and redreſs'd in Towns and Cities, and in all our Villages; and moſt parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cularly in our <hi>Camps and Navies,</hi> where they more than any where elſe (if poſſible) abound; and where there ought to be greater Guard, and Watch againſt them, than any where elſe; according to that Great Precept, <hi>Deut.</hi> 23.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. If this be not done, It cannot be, except God hath left the Earth more than ever yet he hath done; and forſaken it; and walks in the Galleries of Heaven, without Regarding; but that there muſt be a <hi>Viſiting for theſe things;</hi> and that his Soul muſt be avenged of ſuch <hi>a Nation</hi> as this; <hi>Jer.</hi> 5.9. whether by Plague, or Famine, or War, or evil and noiſome Beaſts, or by a Complication of theſe Four: yea, though it be by a Fire yet un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blown,
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:99379:76"/> that is ready to flame out; or by an Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my of Wounded Men, that our Deſtruction muſt come; and much the more becauſe the Light of his Truth is ſo open and clear among us; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe his Mercies and Deliverances have been ſo-Great, and the Methods of his Providence ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uſual; in his unhinging for us the General Laws of <hi>Nature,</hi> in Dethroning, and ſetting on the Throne for our preſervation.

                  </p>
                  <p>There is therefore in the Kingdom of Chriſt a City of Life, and under it a City of Death; a <hi>Ci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Salvation,</hi> whoſe <hi>Walls and Bullwarks</hi> are <hi>Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation;</hi> and <hi>a City of Destruction,</hi> diſtinct from it, and oppoſite to it, <hi>Eſay</hi> 19.18. c. 26.1.

                  <p>This is the <hi>Congregation of the Dead,</hi> Prov. 21.16.

Upon all this, I conclude with that great Scripture, <hi>Hoſea</hi> 10.12. <hi>Sow we to our ſelves in Righteouſneſs, the Righteouſneſs of Repentance,</hi> ſpringing from <hi>Faith in the Blood of Jeſus: Let us break up all our Fallow Grounds:</hi> For the Juſt and proper <hi>time</hi> is near for an <hi>univerſal ſeeking God; till

                  </p>
                  <p>This is indeed prepar'd peculiarly for <hi>Iſrael,</hi> the <hi>Ten Tribes</hi> at their Converſion, after the ſo long Cap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tivity; ſhadowed under <hi>riding, ploughing, breaking the Clods,</hi> till the <hi>ſowing in righteuuſneſs,</hi> at their reſtora<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion.

                  <p>And when this is, there ſhall be a great <hi>Rain, a Rain of Righteouſneſs,</hi> that ſhall come down upon the World.

                  <p>To begin with the firſt: The occaſion of this Context is thus; The Apoſtle having given the Deſcription of the <hi>New or Heavenly Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruſalem-ſtate</hi> in the former Verſes,<note place="margin">You are come to Mount Zion, <hi>&amp;c. ver. 22.</hi> &amp;c.</note> he makes that great practical Application; <hi>See that ye refuſe not him that ſpeaketh</hi> in order to the ſetting up a <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom;</hi> for ſo, by what follows, muſt needs be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended, that the <hi>Speaking</hi> is in order to the ſet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting up a <hi>Kingdom: For if they eſcaped not,</hi> who <hi>refuſed</hi> the ſame great Prince when he would form a <hi>Kingdom</hi> on Earth among the People of <hi>Iſrael,</hi> to be a Type of much a greater <hi>Kingdom; How ſhall we eſcape,</hi> who <hi>refuſe</hi> him, who now <hi>ſpoke from</hi> Heaven in the Effuſion of his <hi>Spirit,</hi> as a <hi>Firſt-Fruits</hi> of his <hi>Kingdom?</hi> and who is to be the Great <hi>Prince,</hi> and who will appear in the Glory of his <hi>Kingdom, the Lord from Heaven,</hi> as he is called 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 15. and then will ſet up a <hi>Kingdom</hi> in the <hi>New Heaven</hi> and the <hi>New Earth,</hi> in a far greater Glory. For though Chriſt came
<pb n="125" facs="tcp:99379:81"/> in great State then, the <hi>Chariots</hi> of <hi>God</hi> were then <hi>twenty thouſand,</hi> &amp;c. As great Princes come with mighty Retinue, of Horſes, and Chariots; ſo did Chriſt on <hi>Mount Sinai:</hi> yet that was but Chriſt, as on <hi>Earth;</hi> this from <hi>Heaven.</hi> Pſal. 68.</p>
                  <p>For his (even the ſame Lord's) <hi>Voice ſhook the Earth; Mount Sinai,</hi> and the Parts about it, did <hi>exceedingly ſhake.</hi> But now, as he is ſetting up a Kingdom both in the <hi>New Heaven</hi> and the <hi>New Earth,</hi> ſo he hath <hi>promis'd; I ſhake not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the Earth,</hi> but the <hi>Heaven alſo.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>It may ſeem ſtrange, an <hi>Earthquake</hi> ſhould be given in <hi>promiſe;</hi> it is rather a Threatning, and Denunciation: but becauſe it is a cloſe Forerun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of the Redemption of the <hi>Servants of Chriſt,</hi> and even of the whole <hi>Creation;</hi> therefore it is given in <hi>promiſe.</hi> And becauſe ſo bleſſed a State is not in preſent, and immediately, but to come; therefore alſo <hi>it is promiſed,</hi> as a thing future, and to come; <hi>I will ſhake.</hi> And becauſe this whole frame of Nature is defiled with Sin, and <hi>Apoſtaſie,</hi> up to the very <hi>Heaven of God</hi> and <hi>his Saints;</hi> therefore Chriſt promiſes to <hi>ſhake</hi> not on<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly the <hi>Earth,</hi> but the <hi>Heaven.</hi> For there are <hi>ſpiritual Wickedneſſes in High Places,</hi> or <hi>Heaven<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lies, Sathan,</hi> and his <hi>Hoſt,</hi> who are the <hi>Princes</hi> under him of the <hi>Power of the Air,</hi> as well as the <hi>Ru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lers</hi> of the <hi>Darkneſs</hi> of this <hi>World;</hi> and ſo the <hi>Heavenlies,</hi> or <hi>Heavenly Places</hi> are more defiled than all the wicked Men on Earth can defile the Earth, though they defile it ſo much; but then <hi>Sathan ſhall fall as Lightning from Heaven;</hi> All muſt be diſlodged, and diſmounted; For that Heaven ſhall be the Reſidence and Palace of
<pb n="126" facs="tcp:99379:82"/> Chriſt and his Saints, and ſhall ſhine down into the new Earth beneath, purified by Fire from the Defilements of Men; ſo Heaven and Earth muſt both be ſhaken. And therefore the <hi>ſhaking of Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth</hi> may well be by <hi>promiſe,</hi> ſince a new Heaven and Earth riſe from hence by <hi>promiſe.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>And, Becauſe all this is fulfilling of <hi>Promiſe,</hi> therefore the Servants of Chriſt at ſo great a <hi>ſhake</hi> of the <hi>Powers of Heaven</hi> and <hi>Earth,</hi> ſhall be leſs afraid than they are of a ſmall <hi>Earthquake</hi> now; they ſhall receive it with Triumph, and re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>joycing, they ſhall ſay, Oh bleſſed Day! Oh bleſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed Appearance! They ſhall <hi>lift up their Heads with joy,</hi> becauſe <hi>their Redemption draweth nigh.</hi> Let us not therefore ſay, That Day will be ſo ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible, how ſhall we endure it! It <hi>ſhall be gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven</hi> us in that <hi>Day</hi> to Rejoice, who are his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deemed.</p>
                  <p>And this Chriſt will do <hi>once more,</hi> even at his <hi>Kingdom,</hi> as if he ſhould ſay, I have <hi>ſhaken,</hi> or permitted, or ordered the <hi>ſhaking</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> many Times, in various Places, and on ſundry Accounts, I have ſhaken <hi>Nations</hi> and <hi>Kingdoms;</hi> but now, ſaith he, I'll do it <hi>once more,</hi> and <hi>once</hi> for all: And we may be ſure, this <hi>ſhaking</hi> hath never been yet; for there hath not yet been a <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king</hi> ſo univerſal, and things have never yet been ſo <hi>ſhaken,</hi> but they have gotten again into their old poſture, ſtate, and, as we ſay, wont, ſo as to need to be <hi>ſhaken</hi> again. But this <hi>once</hi> is like the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion <hi>Jerem.</hi> 16.21. <hi>Behold, I will for this once, I will cauſe them to know my might:</hi> I will do it ſo at the Great Converſion of the <hi>Gentiles</hi> then ſpoken of; It ſhall never need to be done any
<pb n="127" facs="tcp:99379:82"/> more; They ſhall know by <hi>that once,</hi> for ever,<note place="margin">Even as it ſhall be known to my People <hi>Iſrael,</hi> A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mos <hi>4.13.</hi> For in this Kingdom that Name is known indeed, which was known but in Type, <hi>Exod. 6.3.</hi>
                     </note> that <hi>my name is Jehovah.</hi> God hath done theſe things in a Degree, and in ſome meaſure a Hun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dred and a Hundred Times. But now they ſhall be done <hi>once</hi> for all.</p>
                  <p>I am fully aſſured, we ſhall All be at this <hi>ſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Earth:</hi> You may think you may be in your Graves; but you ſhall certainly be brought forth, to ſee, and <hi>feel</hi> God's doing this thing <hi>once. The Earth ſhall caſt out it's Dead</hi> by the beginnings of it, that all may ſee it in its Fulneſs.</p>
                  <p>Now this Doing the Thing ſhall make a great Change, a <hi>Tranſpoſe</hi> of the Things, that are, or have been <hi>made,</hi> or <hi>done.</hi> The Word <hi>Metathe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſis</hi> ſignifies a Diſpoſe of Things out of the Places where they had been, into Places where they had not been before; or into a different Order or State. And it is of very great importance, becauſe it may be a Tranſpoſe for the better, or for the worſe: <hi>Enoch</hi> was thus <hi>Tranſpos'd;</hi> the ſame Word is us'd ſeveral times concerning him, <hi>Heb.</hi> 11.5. and it was highly for the better, he was <hi>Tranſlated</hi> to Heaven without <hi>Dying;</hi> So <hi>Tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pos'd.</hi> It is uſed for the <hi>Galatians</hi> being <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moved to another Goſpel,</hi> and that was for the worſe, <hi>Gal.</hi> 1.5. This <hi>ſhake</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> ſhall make a great <hi>Tranſpoſe</hi> of Things; Many poor Perſons, that have feared God, and yet <hi>embrac'd
<pb n="128" facs="tcp:99379:83"/> Dunghils,</hi> who have been forc'd to lye on the Earth, in the Duſt, and in the filth of Things, ſhall be <hi>Tranſpos'd;</hi> for they ſhall <hi>Inherit the Throne of Glory,</hi> 1 Sam. ch. 2. The Bodies of Saints, that lye in the Earth, or wherever, in the Dark, the <hi>Duſt of Death,</hi> ſhall be <hi>Tranſpos'd;</hi> they ſhall ſhine above: But on the other ſide, the Great, the Rich, and the Brave, and the Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norable, that have been High and Honorable, they will be wofully <hi>Tranſpos'd;</hi> they ſhall be turned down into a State of <hi>Everlaſting Contempt.</hi> And ſo there ſhall be a <hi>Tranſlation,</hi> a <hi>Tranſpoſe,</hi> of the very Creation, out of this Earth, as under the Curſe and Defilement, into a <hi>new Earth,</hi> and of the <hi>Heaven</hi> into a <hi>new Heaven;</hi> not where <hi>Spiritual Wickedneſſes,</hi> but <hi>Chriſt</hi> and his Saints, ſhall in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>habit. Things ſhall not ceaſe to be, but ſhall be changed, and removed, ſome for the better, ſome for the worſe, as to themſelves.</p>
                  <p>But all Things of this World ſhall then be chang'd and remov'd; All the Things that have been <hi>made</hi> or <hi>done,</hi>

                     </gap>. There are great Things in the World of all kinds made or done, Great Palaces, great Cities, great Temples or (as we call them) Churches, Great Caſtles, Fortifications, Navies. There are other great Things <hi>made</hi> and <hi>done.</hi> There are the ſeveral Laws and Conſtitutions of Government, great Volumes of Books, great Furniture of Palaces and Houſes, Bravery of Equipage and Apparel, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quiſite Engines and curious Pictures; all theſe are Things that have been <hi>made,</hi> or <hi>done.</hi> There are the heaps of Gold, and Silver; ſo impreſſed, ſo minted, ſo coined: All theſe, and an unexpreſſible

It ſhall be upon the <hi>High</hi> and <hi>Lofty,</hi> every one that is <hi>lifted up</hi> ſhall be <hi>brought low:</hi> It ſhall be upon all the <hi>Cedars of Lebanon,</hi> and <hi>upon all the Oaks of Baſhan,</hi> both in a natural and figu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rative Senſe; and upon all the <hi>High Mountains,</hi> the mountainous Towers, and Piles of Building; upon all great <hi>Ships,</hi> thoſe floating Palaces; the <hi>Loftineſs</hi> of Men ſhall be <hi>brought low,</hi> and the <hi>Haughtineſs</hi> of <hi>Men</hi> ſhall be <hi>humbled,</hi> and the <hi>High Looks</hi> ſhall be <hi>bowed down.</hi> And they ſhall <hi>caſt their Images of Gold,</hi> and <hi>Silver;</hi> he means not only their <hi>Idolatrous Images,</hi> but their mint<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Gold and Silver, bearing the <hi>Images</hi> of Princes, which <hi>Gold</hi> and <hi>Silver</hi> they commit Idolatry with alſo; to the <hi>Bats</hi> and the <hi>Moles;</hi> to go into the <hi>Caves,</hi> and the <hi>Rocks,</hi> and the <hi>Tops of the rug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ged Rocks, for fear of the Lord,</hi> and <hi>for the glory of his Majeſty;</hi> and all this in the <hi>Day</hi> when he <hi>riſes to ſhake terribly, once for all, the Earth.</hi> Oh how great will this <hi>Tranſpoſe</hi> then be!</p>
                  <p>And then all the <hi>Religion</hi> that <hi>Men</hi> have <hi>made</hi> ſhall become a perfect Tranſpoſe into a Nullity; and indeed, there is not a greater <hi>Poema</hi> or more made thing, than Falſe Religion, and particularly the Religion of <hi>Popery:</hi> it is a ſtrange kind of Fabrick, a ſtrange kind of Frame; ſo indeed is <hi>Mahometaniſm,</hi> and ſo was <hi>Paganiſm</hi> heretofore, but none like that of <hi>Popery.</hi> But yet, what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever hath been of the Subſtance of either true Natural or Revealed Religion in any Falſe Religi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on adulterating it; ſhall be then <hi>Tranſpos'd</hi> back

<pb n="131" facs="tcp:99379:84"/> This is an <hi>incorruptible Seed</hi> from the <hi>Word</hi> and Truth of God, that <hi>abideth for ever; He that doeth the Will of God abideth for ever;</hi> No Saint ſhall be <hi>Tranſpoſed</hi> out of his Saintſhip; <hi>He that is Righteous, let him be Righteous ſtill; He that is Holy, let him be Holy ſtill.</hi> Theſe Things are <hi>Aſaluta,</hi> not to be ſhaken.</p>
                  <p>And then on the other part, it muſt be ſadly ſaid, that <hi>Wickedneſs</hi> ſhall not be <hi>Tranſpos'd;</hi> in regard of its Guilt; in regard of its Filth; If not <hi>removed in this World</hi> by Faith and Repentance; not <hi>in the World to come;</hi> Wickedneſs ſhall be Wickedneſs ſtill; it ſhall have <hi>a Houſe builded;</hi> it ſhall be eſtabliſhed, <hi>Zech.</hi> 5.11. and it ſhall be <hi>ſetled on its own Baſe,</hi> and wicked Men ſhall be wicked Men ſtill: When once it is come to that Time, there ſhall be no Tranſpoſal; <hi>He that is <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous, let him be <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nrighteous ſtill; He that is Filthy, let him be Filthy ſtill,</hi> Rev. 21.11.</p>

                  </p>
                  <p>I come therefore to the ſecond Head; <hi>viz.</hi> To make Remarks upon the nature of ſuch <hi>Motions</hi> and <hi>Trembles</hi> of the <hi>Earth,</hi> and their Fitneſs to be a Shade of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt;</hi> and wherein they are ſo. And herein I propoſe three things:</p>
                  <p n="1">1. To conſider the ſtrict nature of Earthquakes according to the Scripture-Foundations of Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe concerning them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. To enquire into the Cauſes, why God is pleas'd to make ſuch Concuſſions, and Convulſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons in Nature.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. To obſerve upon the great Metaphorical or Figurative <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> that is, Changes in the preſent State of the World, that have been ſince the <hi>Death</hi> and <hi>Reſurrection</hi> of our Lord; and how the Obſervation of them may be made ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervient to the due Improvement of our Thoughts in regard to the late <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> we have heard of, or been at all ſenſible of more of late.</p>
                  <p>I begin then with the firſt Head, in Four Points.</p>
                  <p>Point I. The Scripture teacheth us, This great Globe of Earth and Water is hung by the <hi>mighty Wiſdom,</hi> Skill, and Power of the great
<pb n="133" facs="tcp:99379:85"/> 
                     <hi>Geometer</hi> of Heaven and Earth,<note place="margin">The Earth being Round, is on eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry ſide encompaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſed with Air and Skie, as they who ſail it round, find, as well as by Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon it is demon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrated.</note> as a Ball in the Air: So we read <hi>Job</hi> 26.7. <hi>He ſtretcheth out the North over the empty Place,</hi> (for ſo to our eye and motion the meer Air ſeems to be) and <hi>he hangeth the Earth upon nothing.</hi> I know this is a Point proper to <hi>Philoſophical</hi> Diſcuſſion, that it may go as far, as it can, upon: But thoſe Queſtions God asked <hi>Job</hi> 38.4. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> would poſe the wiſeſt of the World; <hi>Declare, if thou haſt underſtanding, Who hath laid the Meaſures of the Earth? If thou knoweſt, who hath ſtretched the Line upon it ſo, that it is in juſt number, weight, and meaſure. Whereupon are the Foundations thereof faſtned? or who laid the Corner-ſtone thereof?</hi> There may be handſome and plauſible <hi>ſolving the Phenomenae</hi> (as they ſpeak) before Men, who know as little, the beſt of them, one as another; but before God, all is but <hi>darkning Counſel by Words without Knowledge.</hi> Now when it is ſo, that the Earth <hi>hangs</hi> thus, How muſt it needs be, that God as he pleaſes may ſhake the <hi>Earth out of its place</hi> with a touch of his hand, and <hi>all the Inhabitants</hi> thereof, and his Enemies particularly be <hi>ſhaken out of it,</hi> or off from it, or whither, or how he pleaſes: For if that bold Man of <hi>Mathematicks</hi> durſt ſay, <hi>Give me where to ſet my foot, and I will remove the Earth,</hi> what can infinite Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding and Power do? or if he does but ſlacken his hand from holding the Ballance even, keeping the Scales of Earth and Air juſt; or if there be ſuch a
<pb n="134" facs="tcp:99379:86"/> one; as with great Reaſon hath been thought; the Poize of the Central Fire, Even, all would be in immediate Confuſion.</p>
                  <p>On this Conſideration then, any kind of Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes is no wonder; the wonder is, they are not every day, and not to the utmoſt. The only ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curity is, the unchangeableneſs of Divine Ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion for ſuch a time as he hath decreed, ſince the Flood; wherein, in all appearance of Reaſon as well as Scripture, there was even in this regard a Jog, as one may ſay of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Ballance is in this regard yet ſo Even, and juſt, that nothing we account moſt ſurely founded, ſtands ſo faſt, ſo firm, and ſecure, as the Earth, that it cannot be moved: So that al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing it to have a <hi>Diurnal,</hi> or every days Revo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution from <hi>Eaſt</hi> to <hi>Weſt;</hi> yet it is with ſuch e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quality, that it diſturbs all upon it, no more, than a Fly ſitting it ſelf faſt on a Globe, is un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſettled by its being turn'd round. Notwithſtand<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing this motion, the <hi>Earth</hi> is <hi>founded on the Seas,</hi> and <hi>Eſtabliſhed on the Floods;</hi> that is, the Waters are ſo every way compacted, under, and about, and over it, that it is as it were <hi>founded</hi> upon it, as on <hi>Pillars of Marble,</hi> which may have been underſtood, firſt according to the excellent forementioned <hi>Theory</hi> of the <hi>Earth:</hi> 2. As the Cement and Fixation of the upper Parts of the Earth is the moiſture it receives from the Waters: 3. As the ambient or round-about Air hath a more immediate force upon the Waters to crowd and keep them cloſe to the Earth, than the Air it ſelf could have upon the Earth, the Water being a middle Body between Air and Earth, even as
<pb n="135" facs="tcp:99379:86"/> the Air is between that ſubtile Matter we call <hi>Ether,</hi> and Air. So that the Earth hath <hi>Foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dations, Pillars, Corner-ſtone</hi> in Scripture-Lan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guage. And this is indeed abſolutely neceſſary for ſuch kind of Bodies, and Works, as are to move and reſt upon this Earth; which is as a <hi>Sea</hi> in regard of the variety of Creatures in it, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in are <hi>Things creeping innumerable,</hi> and <hi>both great</hi> and <hi>ſmall Beaſts;</hi> and <hi>Man</hi> the higheſt Or<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der of <hi>Animals.</hi> Now theſe require ſuch a ſolid Floor and Pavement to move upon, ſuch a Bed to reſt upon: Upon this Earth is the whole Ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>getative Nature, both nouriſhed and ſupported, as in a Nurſery; even from the <hi>Cedar in Leba<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>non</hi> to the <hi>Hyſop</hi> that <hi>grows in the Wall:</hi> Hereon have all the Great Buildings, the Palaces, Caſtles, Towers, multiplied into Cities and Towns their Foundations.</p>
                  <p>Now ſeeing all theſe have their Order, their Quiet, their Safety by the ſteddineſs of the Earth; whenever it is moved, there is an immediate Shatter, Confuſion, Diſorder, Deſolation, an A<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maze, a Horror upon all Creatures of Senſe, and eſpecially of Reaſon; an Affrightment and Ter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ror upon Nature it ſelf; becauſe hereby the great Laws, and Sanctions of Creation, and Providence, are violated. For concerning the Earth, <hi>God ſpake, and it was done; he commanded, and it ſtood faſt,</hi> Pſal. 33.9.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Earth is ſtuff'd with variety of Matter, Humours, and Vapors in its Bowels; Fire, Water, Vapor, Air, Minerals, Sulphur, Piceous Matter. Now it ſelf is ſo made, as to lye cloſe, and to lye ſtill; every clod of Earth compacts it ſelf, and would
<pb n="136" facs="tcp:99379:87"/> lye in as little room as it can. It is heavy, and ſluggiſh, and unapt to move; whereas all the reſt of its Inmates are for Motion and Action, ſome of them of very earneſt and vigorous Motion, and for Propagation and Enlargement of themſelves: The Earth will not move, but on ſome great vio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lence and force; ſo when thoſe working and active Parts find they are fettered, and impriſoned, and cramp'd, they grow furious and outragious, and rend and tear every thing, to make and force their way; and all on the ſudden and at once ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry often; for being either gather'd together in great Caverns and Hollows of the Earth; their Room grows too ſtrait and little, and ſo they are forc'd to tranſplant themſelves; or having, as one may ſay, very often a Spirit of Contradiction one to another, they fall into Feuds and Wars one with another, and they that are overcome and fall under the Maſtery of others, are forc'd, and driven, and made to fly, out with great violence: and the very ſame thing may fall out in divers leſſer Veins and Tubular Paſſages or Pipes in the Earth; where though the Stores of theſe Vapors or Mineral Spirits are leſſer; yet if it be in many of them together, the Conteſt may be very great, and the Fury very diſcompoſing to the Earth.</p>
                  <p>Thus there are within the Earth thoſe Bombs and Mortars, thoſe Cannon and Ordnance, thoſe Battering Rams and Engines, thoſe Mines oft ſprung, and natural Gun-powder and fiery Bul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lets, thoſe leſſer Screwed Guns: all which are the Ammunition of Nature, or rather of the God of Nature: Thus when they are diſcharg'd, and let off, it is with great Noiſe, Dread, and Aſtoniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment,
<pb n="137" facs="tcp:99379:87"/> and oftentimes Deſtruction to the Inhabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tants of the Earth. Who almoſt hath not heard of <hi>Aetna</hi> and <hi>Veſuvius,</hi> and other the Mountains ſpouting Fire in ſeveral Parts of the World? And as there are ſuch conſtant, known, and open E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ruptions in Nature, ſo are there ſecret, ſudden, and extemporary ones.</p>
                  <p>And thus in the Heavens over us there are like Conteſts and Colliſions, falling, and clapping of Clouds, Thunders, Lightnings, fiery Meteors, and flaming Balls, and theſe often correſponding, and as it were holding Intelligence, with the ſame in Earth. And theſe are certainly often Cauſes one of another by the Tone or Link of Air being broken, and the <hi>Elaſtic</hi> Force or Spring of it flying this way and that way; as lately in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica</hi> according to the moſt prudent Accounts from thence: Every thing then muſt needs be torn and havock'd, as thoſe Motions hurry this way or that way, Perſons, Animal Creatures, and Things, at ſuch times.</p>
                  <p>And as theſe are in the World of Nature; ſo are they in the <hi>Political</hi> World; when Nations or People are too full for their Place, and tranſplant themſelves by forcing into other Nations; when Wars, thoſe great Diſputes of Nations ariſe; when People or Armies fall into Mutiny; theſe are Political Earthquakes; and when Men are op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſed in Religion by domineering Superſtition, and Laws of <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niformity,</hi> and impoſing on the Conſciences and Faith of Men; There are Religious <hi>Earthquakes:</hi> The Pſalmiſt puts them altogether, Pſal. 65.7, 8. <hi>Which ſetteth faſt the Mountains being girded with Power; which ſtilleſt the noiſe
<pb n="138" facs="tcp:99379:88"/> of the Seas, the noiſe of their Waves,</hi> and the <hi>multitude of the People.</hi> This God does in Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy, when he keeps all quiet; but there are Times when all theſe being in Hubbub and Mutiny, <hi>the Mountains ſhake</hi> and <hi>roar</hi> together with the <hi>Seas</hi> and <hi>Waves;</hi> and the <hi>Multitude</hi> of People in their <hi>Strivings;</hi> who are therein emphatically called <hi>the Mobile;</hi> that <hi>They that dwell in the utter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>moſt Parts are afraid of theſe Tokens;</hi> thus from one end of Nations, or even of the World, to another, there ariſe dreadful Fears at the <hi>Tokens of God,</hi> unhinging the World; called therefore <hi>Prodigies</hi> and <hi>Portents:</hi> For what Intereſt God hath in theſe, ſhall be ſpoken in the next Parti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cular.</p>
                  <p>I only obſerve further, There are in the Little World by the wreſtling of contrary Humours in the Bodies of Men, ſuch Spoutings of Fire, as in Fevers; ſuch Deluges of Water, as in Dropſies; ſuch Earthquakes in violent Diſeaſes; ſuch ſulphu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reous Vapors in horrid Melancholies or Fits; or in the Arteries and Sinews, as in Gouts and Rheuma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſms; in thoſe Arthritical Pains in the ſtrait and cloſe Tubes of the Body; ſuch Swimmings of the Head, as reſemble what hath been ſpoken of in the outer World; but above all in Conſciences.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Let all theſe things be trac'd, as much as they can to their natural Cauſes; yet Scripture aſcribes all to God, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 148.8. <hi>Fire, Hail, Snow, Vapor, all fulfil his Word: He worketh his Signs and Wonders among the Armies of Heaven and the Inhabitants of the Earth,</hi> and <hi>none can ſtay his hand;</hi> (for all the <hi>Inhabitants of the Earth are reputed as nothing</hi> in ſuch a Caſe, <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.35.)
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:99379:88"/> except he pleaſes to ſtay it himſelf; or <hi>can ſay to him, What doſt thou?</hi> As if they ſhould ſay What doſt thou mean, who haſt <hi>made Heaven and Earth,</hi> and preſerveſt it; to put it into theſe Diſorders? But he gives <hi>no Account of his mat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters</hi> in theſe Things. And ſeeing he holds all natural Cauſes in his hand, and ballances them every moment; what is it to ſay, All theſe Things have their proper Cauſes; but to ſay in true ſenſe, that God does all Theſe; for all Nature is indeed Miracle, conſtant, and as we ſay <hi>in ordinary.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But God indeed does in more lofty Style, and Elegancies, and Eloquences of Language, aſſume to himſelf the Government of theſe affrightful Motions in Heaven, or Earth; <hi>Thun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ders, Lightnings, Earthquakes</hi> throughout Scri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pture; as if they were immediately done by his own hand, as if he took this Globe of Earth and Sea, which he hath <hi>Hung upon nothing,</hi> and <hi>ſhook it out of its place;</hi> or as if he immediately ſhot off his great Pieces either in the Bowels of the Earth, or in the Skies, or ſprung a Mine in the Earth: And it muſt needs be ſo; if all natural, voluntary and fortuitous (as we Poreblind think them) Cauſes work in and out of his hand. For if in the Killing <hi>King Ahab a man drew a Bow at a venture;</hi> or as in the Margin out of the <hi>He<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>brew; In his Simplicity,</hi> without Deſign, with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Aim, and yet it was directed to <hi>Ahab,</hi> as by God's immediate Hand to fulfil his Word up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on him, How much more are all natural Cauſes directed by him! 1 <hi>Kings</hi> 22.34. And thoſe Things which he knows will with ſuch extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary Amazes change the World; he aſcribes them
<pb n="140" facs="tcp:99379:89"/> more emphatically to Himſelf; <hi>His Thunder, his Lightnings; I ſhake Heaven and Earth.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Let us then conſider, Why God does thus diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>order Nature; And I ſhall inſtance in theſe fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lowing Reaſons.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That when we ſee theſe Conteſts, and Jars in Nature, we may adore and praiſe the infinite Wiſdom, Power, and Goodneſs of God, who keeps All ſo much in Peace and Quiet: For as great Engines or Machines, that have various and croſs Wheels and curious Works in them; it requires as great Art, to harmonize them at firſt, ſo great care to keep them in order; and as vaſt Armies call for the higheſt Spirit, Wiſdom, and Conduct of the <hi>Generaliſſimo,</hi> as Men ſpeak, to inſpire them with Order, Peace, Regular Action, in their ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Stations; ſo it is ſaid of God, <hi>Job</hi> 25.2. <hi>Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>minion and Fear are with him. He maketh Peace in his high,</hi> (and in his <hi>Deep) Places alſo. Is there any number of his Armies?</hi> All which he yet keeps in Peace, as he pleaſes. Oh therefore that (as in that <hi>Song of Praiſe,</hi> Pſal. 107.) Men conſidering All theſe Things well, would make it<note n="‖" place="margin">Glory to God.</note> the Foot of every Thing! <hi>Oh that Men would praiſe the Lord for his wonderful Works to the Children of Men!</hi> For we ſee by a little what great Things he can do. <hi>Whoſo therefore is wiſe,</hi> and will obſerve <hi>theſe Things, even he ſhall underſtand the loving kindneſs of the Lord.</hi> For indeed, That on which the Pride, and Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phaneneſs, and Inſolency of Men is grounded, is, That God will ſtill from Time to Time keep Things in the Quiet and Peace he generally does:
<pb n="141" facs="tcp:99379:89"/> And if he does not, they fall down into Death and Ruine immediately in his doing otherwiſe: He therefore ſhews ſometimes by ſuch Diſorders, what he always does, how he exerciſes <hi>Long-ſuf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fering, Loving kindneſs in the Earth;</hi> for if he did otherwiſe, Nature would be always cracking in pieces; and if it were ſo, What could the greateſt <hi>Monarchs</hi> ſay to it? Would <hi>they ſtay his hand,</hi> or would <hi>they render him a Recompence</hi> for not doing as they think he ſhould and ought to do? <hi>Their Recompence he would ſpeedily re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn upon their own heads.</hi> God therefore ſhews, How all the <hi>World</hi> is bound and beholden to him by ſhewing at ſuch Times, what he can do with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any Controul, and yet does not; and what he does in maintaining Order and Peace when none can compell him to it, if, He did not pleaſe to do ſo.</p>
                  <p n="2">2.<note place="margin">Men loath what they have conſtantly, as if it were no Argument for fear of God; as if God were tied to do ſo; but think at leaſt, ſuch Wonders of ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Power, which they do not ſee every day, would, <hi>like one from the Dead,</hi> move to Repentance: But even this depends on Grace.</note> That he may give Witneſſes and Demonſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of his Wrath, Juſtice, and Power to; either, as he pleaſes; puniſh, and ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ecute Judgment from Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven; or move to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance: For as he gives <hi>Fruitful Times</hi> and <hi>Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons</hi> that he might not <hi>leave himſelf without wit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of his Goodneſs lead<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to Repentance;</hi> ſo of his Wrath and Juſtice to neceſſitate Men that way; For all theſe Things Preach Repentance, and Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation
<pb n="142" facs="tcp:99379:90"/> aloud; and for that End I have thus ſuperadded to the Diſcourſe of Repentance.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That God may give notice of any great Chan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ges he will make in the World, that are near at hand, and which within any little Time he will make in it, he gives Warning by <hi>Earthquakes</hi> and other unuſual Things: For ſo in ſpight of all that can be ſaid to the contrary, God hath ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nerally uſher'd in any great Changes, he hath made in the World, by ſuch <hi>Signs</hi> and <hi>Wonders</hi> in <hi>Heaven,</hi> and <hi>Shakings of the Earth</hi> beneath: and therefore with great Right he cloaths his De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nunciations and Threats of ſuch great Judgments in ſuch Language of <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightnings,</hi> and <hi>Earthquakes.</hi> A very remarkable Inſtance we have of this in the <hi>Prophet Amos.</hi> When God was about, as it were to Ride a Circuit in Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Nations for <hi>Three Tranſgreſſions,</hi> and for <hi>Four</hi> even upon each ſingle Nation or Peo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ple, <hi>Amos</hi> dates his <hi>Prophecy two Years before the Earthquake in the Days of</hi> Uzziah.<note place="margin">Amos 1.1.</note> How general that was, is not known to us. But there is plain im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance, God firſt began to give notice of his Judgments by <hi>Amos</hi> his <hi>Prophecy</hi> in his two firſt Chapters. That not prevailing to Repentance, he gave a loud Alarm by the <hi>Earthquake,</hi> which it is moſt probable, was as general as thoſe Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions threatned by <hi>Amos.</hi> Then follows the Judgment it ſelf on the ſeveral People nam'd and executed by the <hi>Aſſyrian</hi> and <hi>Babylonian</hi> Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>queſts. And why was there a mention of the <hi>Earthquake two Years</hi> after; if God had not pleaſed to give that Intimation, that an <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi>
                     <pb n="143" facs="tcp:99379:90"/> was a fit Forerunner of that Judiciary Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs, that follows in thoſe two Chapters of <hi>Amos;</hi> ſo our Lord <hi>Matt.</hi> 24. makes <hi>Earthquakes</hi> in <hi>Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vers Places,</hi> the certain Forerunners of the Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lations of <hi>Jeruſalem.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. The <hi>Lord Jehovah</hi> is pleaſed to ſuffer <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes,</hi> becauſe he hath determined upon this one <hi>Earthquake,</hi> wherein he will <hi>ſhake</hi> not <hi>only the Earth,</hi> but the <hi>Heaven alſo;</hi> a <hi>great Earthquake, ſuch as hath not been ſince men were upon earth; ſo mighty an Earthquake, and ſo great; wherein every Iſland ſhall flee away, and the Mountains ſhall not be found,</hi> Revel. 16.18.20.

Although This ſhall be greater, and to far greater purpoſe in <hi>the new Heaven,</hi> and the <hi>new Earth</hi> to perfection: Whereas That <hi>Flood</hi> brought forth <hi>a Heaven and Earth</hi> for the worſe; and Men grew as, and more wicked; but here <hi>Righteouſneſs ſhall dwell,</hi> and
<pb n="144" facs="tcp:99379:91"/> This ſhall be the greateſt ſince <hi>Man was on Earth.</hi> This is the <hi>Time of Trouble,</hi> of deep <hi>Tribulation</hi> and <hi>Temptation,</hi> ſuch as none <hi>ever was before,</hi> to All, but the Servants of God and Chriſt, <hi>Dan.</hi> 12.1. <hi>Mat.</hi> 24.21. <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.10. <hi>c.</hi> 7.14.</p>
                  <p>Now therefore, It <hi>becomes him, by whom are All things,</hi> and <hi>for whom are All Things;</hi> ſeeing he hath determined ſo great an <hi>Earthquake</hi> at laſt, to give ſuch <hi>Terellaes</hi> of it; ſuch little Parts, Pieces, and Models of it, that might Inlighten, Awaken, and Aſſure the World concerning it; and to have ſet up ſuch a Pyramid of it by the <hi>Flood,</hi> in general to all the World; and to <hi>Sodom,</hi> and the Cities about it in more particular, in the Beginning of the World; and to ſpeak in the Elo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quence of what he will do, on every occaſion of a greater Judgment on any Nation or People; and to ioyn with it the <hi>Thunder</hi> and <hi>Lightnings</hi> of his <hi>Power</hi> and <hi>Voice,</hi> that are as the <hi>Shakings of Heaven;</hi> and generally fall in with the <hi>Sha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king of the Earth.</hi> And thus we find all along the Scripture, and with great Relation to this ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry <hi>Earthquake</hi> uſhering in the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> and the <hi>Deſtruction of Babylon,</hi> the great Symbol of his Enemies; ſo <hi>Pſal.</hi> 18.7. <hi>Eſay</hi> 13.13. with very many Pieces more.

                     <hi>Modeſty</hi> and ſhame of our own Unworthineſs and horrid Nakedneſs; This Good <hi>Heed-taking</hi> not to run into God as a <hi>Conſuming Fire,</hi> is moſt ſhewn, exercis'd and practis'd in timely Repentance.

                  <p>And to this purpoſe, Let theſe very late <hi>Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of the Earth</hi> be conſider'd in all the forego<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Diſcourſe; for I cannot but be perſwaded, they are Pledges of that great Change, that ſhall ſuddenly be in the World in the Fall of the whole <hi>Papal</hi> and <hi>Antichriſtian State;</hi> beſides their ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral ſtrong Motive to <hi>Repentance,</hi> as they ſpeak God, both in his Divine Power, and Ability to execute Wrath; as alſo in his <hi>Goodneſs, Long-ſuffering,</hi> and <hi>Patience, leading to Repentance;</hi> and how much more, if the Approach of his Kingdom it ſelf, the greateſt <hi>Motive to Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> be by it declar'd ſo near.</p>
                  <p>That I may therefore improve ſo remarkable a Providence upon the <hi>Engliſh Plantation</hi> in <hi>Ja<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>maica,</hi> (which is therefore to be reputed a part of <hi>England</hi> it ſelf) and the ſo gentle and tender Admonition of that Motion of the Earth among our Selves (as alſo on other Parts) I would diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe them firſt, as an Argument to Repentance, and then, that they are a Prediction of a great Change on the World.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. I firſt conſider that of <hi>Jamaica,</hi> which, we muſt needs acknowledge a part of our Selves; and therefore it is to be looked upon as <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land,</hi> though beyond the Sea; and ſo we are all equally therein concerned, particularly that many of us had Intereſts, and Relations that ſuffered in it; we are therefore nearly concern'd; and ſo are ſtrongly called upon to Repentance by it; and the more, that it fell ſo particularly upon that Town or Port, that bore the Enſigns of So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereignty
<pb n="149" facs="tcp:99379:93"/> and Government, called <hi>Port Royal;</hi> that was the <hi>Key of the Iſland</hi> and Plantation, the Port and Harbor, the Seat of the <hi>Kings</hi> Houſe, and of the Houſes of the moſt conſidera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble <hi>Merchants</hi> and Traders; and of the Defence and Strength of the Place, by its <hi>Baſtions</hi> and Fortifications.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I conſider, that the Judgment bears a very great Reſemblance to the Judgment on <hi>Sodom</hi> and <hi>Gomorrah;</hi> For the Thunder, and Lightning, and Balls of Fire that came down from Heaven; according to the moſt credible Accounts of Eye-witneſſes; though the Town was not, that I have heard, touched by the Fire, carry the Signatures of <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Judgment after a ſerene <hi>Riſing</hi> of the <hi>Sun,</hi> which muſt be by an <hi>Earthquake</hi> and <hi>In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>undation;</hi> for the <hi>Earthquake</hi> and <hi>Inundation</hi> was in the Suddenneſs, and dreadful Deſolation, and Deſtruction that it made, How like to that which turn'd <hi>Sodom</hi> into a <hi>Lake</hi> or <hi>Dead Sea</hi> to this day! And herein what was ſhort of <hi>Sodom</hi>'s Judgment in the Fire, was made up in the Dread of the <hi>Earthquake:</hi> and ſo many, about 2000 Perſons periſhed, as by that newly ſober publiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Account before nam'd appears; <hi>A Shade of the Place, and of the Parts on which the Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake had greateſt Power is given in it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>From hence then I argue;</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it is not to be aſcrib'd to natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes any other way, than as the ſupreme Counſel and Being hath all Cauſes in his Hand, and at his Diſpoſe. If it had been only an <hi>Earthquake</hi> and <hi>Inundation,</hi> there had appeared leſs of God, and of his Supream Dominion; But when there was
<pb n="150" facs="tcp:99379:94"/> a Correſpondence, and as it were Intelligence be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Heaven, and Earth, and Sea, above and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; It leads us to conſider Him, <hi>Who does whatever he pleaſes in Heaven and in Earth, and in all Deep Places.</hi> He cauſeth the Vapors to aſcend from the Earth, He maketh Lightnings for the Rain, He bringeth the Wind out of his Treaſures, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 135.6, 7. Were not Men reſol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, as <hi>Pharaoh,</hi> to <hi>ſtand</hi> up like <hi>Rock</hi> againſt God they muſt needs acknowledge Him in this: The Works of God, his Judgment on <hi>Sodom</hi> of old, is an <hi>Enſample</hi> to all After Ages; How much more This ſo upon our own Times, on whom the <hi>Ends of the World are come;</hi> though we had no ſhare in it, but it was upon another People; How much more when ſo upon our Selves, though in another Climate!</p>
                  <p n="2">2. I conſider, as a further Argument to Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance herein that great Scripture <hi>Amos</hi> 4.6. That it comes upon this Nation in a Train, and Connexion of Judgments; all within leſs than half the <hi>Age of a Man</hi> at <hi>Moſes</hi>'s Computation:<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Or</hi> 70 <hi>Years,</hi> Pſal. 90.10.</note> The Peſtilence and Dreadful Plague in the Year 1665. The Fire on this City in 1666. The ſeveral Inteſtine Commotions, and Wars a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad: And now it is come to this Judgment, though but on ſome of us; yet it was but ſo up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on <hi>Iſrael,</hi> v. 11. <hi>I have overthrown ſome of you,</hi> as <hi>God overthrew Sodom and Gomorrah.</hi> And this is the laſt, till God come to a Judgment ſo great, he would not name; <hi>Therefore will I do Thus, or this, unto thee. Therefore prepare to meet thy God, Oh Iſrael,</hi> in his ſevereſt Judgment,
<pb n="151" facs="tcp:99379:94"/> if thou <hi>return not.</hi> And ſo according to the ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral courſe of the Word and Dealings of God, eſpecially with a People under ſuch a clearneſs of Divine Revelation as we are: It muſt needs be, whether Men will <hi>Hear or Forbear.</hi> It muſt end in utter Deſtruction, if upon this we do not <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God,</hi> according (I ſay) to the General Rules, and Standards of his Word.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. That great Admonition of our Saviour's is an utter Prohibition of our ſheltring our ſelves under ſuch an Imagination, that they were <hi>greater Sinners</hi> than we are; for he hath ſolemnly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nounced, That whoever does not <hi>Repent,</hi> ſhall not only <hi>Periſh,</hi> but ſhall <hi>Periſh</hi>

So that without <hi>Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> we are always under the Impendency, the hanging over of ſo great Judgments upon us; as came indeed upon the <hi>Jews</hi> in the <hi>Roman Deſola<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> ſoon after; and muſt upon this Nation ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to ordinary Rules, and Standards of the Word, and Providence of God, as I have ſaid: But if not; ſeeing that Word of Chriſt ſhall be true, that we ſhall <hi>likewiſe periſh,</hi> if we do <hi>not Repent;</hi> We muſt be raiſed to that Greateſt <hi>Earthquake, Thunder,</hi> and <hi>Lightning,</hi> and the Dreadful <hi>Tempeſt,</hi> the <hi>Snares, Fire</hi> and <hi>Brim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtone</hi> God will then Rain, and the <hi>Horrible Tem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peſt,</hi> that ſhall be the Portion of every wicked and impenitent Perſon's <hi>Cup,</hi> Pſal. 11.6. at that Time, that Day, that ſhall <hi>burn as an Oven,</hi> and <hi>conſume the Wicked Root and Branch;</hi> at that <hi>Battel</hi> of the <hi>Great Day of God Almighty</hi> in the

                     <hi>Valley of Jehoſaphat</hi> and <hi>Armageddon,</hi> when he will <hi>go through,</hi> and <hi>burn up all together;</hi> What Cauſe have we therefore to <hi>look diligently,</hi> we may be <hi>found of him in Peace</hi> at that Day, and not in a <hi>State of War,</hi> of that <hi>War,</hi> that is a <hi>War</hi> in <hi>Righteouſneſs</hi> or a <hi>War</hi> of <hi>Just</hi> and <hi>Righteous Judgment</hi> in the <hi>Day of Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. I obſerve from ſo many Perſons, taken away ſo ſuddenly in <hi>Jamaica;</hi> How great an Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it makes againſt Truſt to a <hi>Death-Bed-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance,</hi> when the very Poſſibilities of a <hi>Death-Bed</hi> to <hi>Repent</hi> upon may be ſo ſnatch'd from us: and therefore with how great Force and Evidence, and with what a juſt Timouſneſs, the Obſervati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons on theſe Providences There, and Here, are to be adjuſted to theſe Diſcourſes on the general ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity of Repentance, and the great Hazard of committing our ſelves to the Adventure of a <hi>Death-Bed-Repentance;</hi> when ſo ſuddenly Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence, that is as in a Courſe of <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> and hath given us ſuch Warnings, may take us <hi>away living,</hi> and, if we Repent not, <hi>in his Wrath.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="5">5. As between thoſe two Diſpenſations of Provi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence; the Dreadful Earthquake in <hi>Jamaica,</hi> and that here; I conſider with what a Goodneſs, and yet with a Faithfulneſs to move to Repentance, God hath ſhewn us both the Tenderneſs and the Skill of his Hand in the Motion of the Earth we were ſenſible of. For as in the moſt admirable Know<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge of his Almighty Hand, he took up our Earth, and poiz'd it; and in the Doing of it, did as it were ſay, <hi>How ſhall I give thee up,</hi> London? <hi>How ſhall I make thee as</hi> Admah <hi>and</hi> Zeboim, <hi>the
<pb n="153" facs="tcp:99379:95"/> Cities the Lord overthrew, as</hi> Jamaica, <hi>or</hi> Port-Royal? <hi>My Heart is turned within me, my Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentings are kindled together; I will not execute the fierceneſs of my Wrath; I am God, and not Man; I will not enter into this City,</hi> Hoſea 11.8, 9. as into <hi>Jamaica.</hi> Behold then on Them <hi>Severity,</hi> to Us <hi>Goodneſs,</hi> if we <hi>Turn to him</hi> in his Goodneſs, and ſo <hi>abide</hi> in it; or elſe accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to ordinary Rules we muſt be cut off alſo.</p>
                  <p>And there is indeed moſt of the Power and Wiſdom of God in doing ſo much, and no more; For a rude and unskilful Hand can Throw Down, Spoil and Deſtroy; but only an Underſtanding and Almighty Hand could <hi>weigh the Earth as in Scales;</hi> and as in a <hi>Ballance,</hi> lift up and ſet down in the very ſame place and ſtate. And how much more of Love and Grace to melt and ſoften us! as if he had ſaid, Behold what I am able to do, to Ruin you in a moment! But I will only ſhew what I can Do, and I will <hi>Do you no hurt.</hi> Oh that this <hi>Riches</hi> of <hi>Goodneſs, Long ſuffering</hi> and <hi>Patience,</hi> might <hi>lead us to Repentance!</hi> who himſelf <hi>ſtaid his own Hand,</hi> and ſaid to Himſelf, <hi>What am I doing?</hi> (when none elſe could) and <hi>He did it not.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>I come now to the Second Head I propos'd, for the Improvement of our Thoughts on theſe <hi>Earthquakes</hi> in general, but particularly of that but juſt, a <hi>Motion</hi> of the <hi>Earth</hi> in this City, and the Royal Camp, and other parts beyond the Sea; That it is predictive, and foretelling of a great Change in the World: And of this I give theſe following Arguments.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is beyond all denial moſt evident, that Scripture makes uſe of <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> as the Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veyance of its Deſcription of the great Works and
<pb n="154" facs="tcp:99379:96"/> Changes God will make for the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> till it appears: That courſe of Earthquakes Providence hath been in of late years, is ſurely a Declaration of thoſe great Changes he is about to make, firſt by the Succeſſion of that <hi>Kingdom,</hi> and then by its own Appearance: For if firſt Chriſt convey his <hi>Kingdom</hi> by <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> as <hi>Types</hi> and Pledges; it is but reaſonable to expect, when he alarms the World with <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> he has ſomething to do more than ordinary in the Advancement of it; elſe his ſo great uſe of them in his Word would be but as the <hi>ſounding of the Mountains,</hi> and <hi>Amuſe</hi> in vain. By the ſo often uſe of <hi>Earthquakes</hi> he teaches us to expect by them; Seeing as on one ſide he uſes <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes</hi> in his Word to expreſs great Things for his <hi>Kingdom</hi> by; ſo on the other ſide he uſes <hi>Earthquakes,</hi> that are ſo in Fact to and in his <hi>Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vidence,</hi> to foretell ſome Changes for his <hi>King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom</hi> following them, according to his Word.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The Nations, and Places, where this Moti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the Earth came, are ſuch, as are cloſely concerned in the Change, that God is about to make; being either of the <hi>Proteſtant</hi> Profeſſion, or of the <hi>Ten Kings,</hi> that yet <hi>give their King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom to the Beaſt.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That God was pleas'd therefore to guide the Motion of unquiet Vapors over ſo many Coun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tries and Cities, it was like the ſending the <hi>Cup</hi> and <hi>Yoke</hi> in <hi>Jeremy</hi> to ſo many Nations, on whom he would execute his Diſpleaſure by <hi>Nebuchadnez<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zar,</hi> Jerem. c. 25. c. 27. ſo now he hath ſent by this <hi>Earthquake,</hi> as it were by a Meſſenger, to make known to the Nations his <hi>Kingdom</hi> ſo near. For ſo mild and gentle a Motion, that had no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing of Wrath, and execution of Vengeance
<pb n="155" facs="tcp:99379:96"/> in its Commiſſion, ſeems entruſted only with ſo great a Notice. And I cannot but hope, and am even aſſured, That this City is to bear ſo happy a Part in the <hi>Kingdom of Christ,</hi> that it ſhall be <hi>preſerved</hi> for his <hi>Servant</hi> David<hi>'s ſake,</hi> and that God in Chriſt is the <hi>Holy one in the midſt of it.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. That which above all aſſures me ſo, is That <hi>Sure Word of Prophecy;</hi> that Time is ſo near for the Succeſſion of the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> (which is by <hi>Prophecy</hi> deſcrib'd by a great <hi>Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quake</hi>) that I can underſtand nothing by this Move; but that Introducing, or Bringing it in with the <hi>Call of the Witneſſes,</hi> and the <hi>Fall of the Tenth</hi> of <hi>the Great City:</hi> For I cannot underſtand that there is Space or Room for any other Change but of That to the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt,</hi> entring into its <hi>Succeſſion;</hi> wherein all ſhall have the Ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantages of Repentance and Reformation by the <hi>pouring out of the Spirit,</hi> and the <hi>Preaching of the everlaſting Goſpel;</hi> even to all the World; and the Converts of that Time ſhall be, as the <hi>Drops of Dew from the Womb of the Morning:</hi> A Change of ſo great advantages to the World, that none have any reaſon to be offended, or to complain of the Tydings; except They, <hi>who hate to be Reform'd.</hi> I deſire no other <hi>Beauty of Feet</hi> or <hi>Face</hi> than to <hi>bring</hi> and <hi>pub<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

It is all holy, pure, ſpiritual, benign, and beneficent, to thoſe who have but any Deſires after God Chriſt, and Goodneſs, both in inward and outward Boun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties: There is greateſt reaſon it ſhould be <hi>dai<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                     <pb n="156" facs="tcp:99379:97"/> and have not <hi>heard them.</hi> Oh therefore, that this may be what this gracious Heave of the Earth does preſage; (as I have great Aſſurance it does,) That there is no more danger by it, than this, That we ſhould take notice; This Earth with great Sedateneſs gave a Motion with joy, as <hi>John Baptiſt in the Womb</hi> to foretell; It is <hi>with all its King<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">

                  </p>
                  <p>But though I have endeavoured to make good my way all along; yet I would in the Concluſion give a more ſolemn Anſwer to the chief Objecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, I have taken notice of.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objct.</hi> 1. Some of the ſagacious Obſervers of Nature have ſo trac'd extraordinary Events to their Cauſes, that they have foretold particularly Earth<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quakes, by obſerving the Ripeneſs of natural Cau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes for them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. Whatever Obſervations the wiſeſt of Mankind have made, they are not able, ſo far to penetrate the Screws of Natural Cauſes, fitted to the neceſſitating one another to ſuch Effects; but that ſupernatural Agents may give a <hi>Lift</hi> to the <hi>Wheels</hi> of Second Cauſes, that uſually <hi>move,</hi> but <hi>on Earth,</hi> viz. in a natural way; to move much <hi>above Earth,</hi> that is, Supernaturally: and in the ſame manner to ſet Bars to, or hinder their Motions. <hi>Ezek.</hi> 1.19.20.</p>
                  <p>Now that there are ſuch Supernatural Agents; the very Evidences of rational, and even ſenſible Experiments compel the ſtouteſt Gainſayers to
<pb n="157" facs="tcp:99379:97"/> confeſs, but as they bid defiance to all Things for the ſake of their <hi>Atheiſtic</hi> Sentiments.</p>

                  <head>THE PREFACE TO THE READER.</head>
                  <p>IT may ſeem unſeaſonable, and mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>roſe, to deny the value of any kind of Repentance, in ſuch an Age as this; wherein there is a Generation ariſen, Oh how lofty are their Eyes, and their Eye-lids lifted up with Scorn and Diſdain of all Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion! An Age ſo irreligious, that it ſeems neceſſary to gather up all the Frag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments, tho but of a ſeeming Piety, and make the most of them, rather than to call things to ſo ſtrict a Ballance: A thinner, and more dilute Repentance, than would formerly have admitted a Man into a viſible Church, may at
<pb facs="tcp:99379:101"/> ſuch a time as this, hope for Heaven.</p>
                  <p>To all this I muſt anſwer, <hi>Firſt,</hi> The Looſeneſs of an Age does not ſlac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken or diſſolve Eternal Laws; Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom abates nothing of its price, of that timely and early ſearch after it, whether Men think good to give it, or whether they will forbear. It hath no meaner Eſteem of it ſelf, becauſe Folly, that is, ſimple, and knoweth nothing, ſitteth upon the high places of the City, full of Noiſe and Clamor, and entices to its Entertainments the Multitude, and Grandeur of the World.</p>
                  <p>All the Severities of Scripture, that make the way to Heaven narrow, and the Gate ſtrait, ſtand like a Rock, from Generation to Generation, alike in all times. Nothing that is prodi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gally looſed on Earth, in compliance with a licentious Age, will be there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore looſed in Heaven.</p>
                  <p>The goodly price of a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance,</hi> at which God is priz'd by Men, even then, when Religion is at the lowest, is rejected ofteſt with Indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb facs="tcp:99379:101"/> and the everlaſting State pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chaſed by it, may be ſadly called <hi>an Aceldama, a Field of Blood.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>If this Severity of Divine Truth offend any one, The Reſolution is that of our Saviour.<note n="†" place="margin">Mat. 15.17.</note> Every Plant, whether Perſon or Thing, that our Heavenly Father hath not planted, ſhall be rooted up.</p>
                  <p n="2">
                     <hi>2.</hi> It is no improbable way of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſting against Atheiſm, and general Irreligion, by the ſtrict Doctrins of Chriſtianity, as well as by Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of Reaſon: Nay, Authorita<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tive Applications of the Truth of God, often ſtrike the Conſcience with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the Reaſon, ſooner and quicker than induſtrious Attempts upon the Reaſon: as Lightning melts the Steel, and neg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lects the Scabbard. Preſſings of Faith, Repentance, Holineſs, Eternal Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment make Men (even <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nbelievers) fall down upon their faces, when the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crets of their Hearts are diſcovered, and confeſs God is there</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:99379:102"/>
                  <p>For the Soul of Man is more eaſily wrought upon by thoſe domeſtick Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bukes, God gives it by his Word, than by more ſolemn Treaties.</p>
                  <p>Eſpecially, corrupted Reaſon takes upon it ſelf to be a lawful Authority, when an honourable War is commen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced againſt it by the better Reaſon on the other ſide; It contemns Laws of Diſcourſe, as precarious, and makes account, it gives Reaſon for Reaſon. But the Rod of God ſhaken over it makes it tremble, and confeſs it ſelf a Slave: Thus the Slaves in the Sto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry were more eaſily reduced by the ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vile Chaſtiſements they were acquainted with, than by the force of Armies. Atheiſm grows the prouder generally for being reaſoned with: It does but diſſemble, while it pretends its diſeaſe to be in the Head, which it knows in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed to be in the ſenſual Heart. And therefore is pleaſed to be ſtruck in the Head; but cannot endure to be wounded in the Heart, which the Word of God eſpecially aims at.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:99379:102"/>
                  <p>Not, but that it is indeed a moſt generous and honourable Atchieve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment to ſhew Religion to be the high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Reaſon; and to detect thoſe pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tending Sons of Reaſon, of the great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt Irrationality. But it is ſtill to be acknowledged, the plain preaching of the Goſpel, which the Apoſtle calls the Fooliſhneſs and Weakneſs of God, is alone wiſer and ſtronger than Men: The Reaſon of that, couched under an Heavenly Authority of Truth, car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries thoſe <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                     </gap>, thoſe migh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty Weapons, whereby every high Ima<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gination and Reaſoning is to be ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dued, that lifts up it ſelf againſt God.</p>
                  <p>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon this occaſion, I cannot, but bewail thoſe unhappy Diviſions, that have ſeparated the Preachers of the Goſpel one from another, and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by opened a Lane for that Black Troop to advance in, and made the Trum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pet of the Goſpel to ſound ſo incertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, that it hath rather ſcattered Men, than prepared them to the Battel.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:99379:103"/>
                  <p>Our Saviour foreſeeing the Conſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quences hereof, according to that great Maxim of his,<note n="‖" place="margin">Mat. 12.25.</note> 
                     <hi>Every Kingdom divided againſt it ſelf is brought to Deſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lation,</hi> did ſo earneſtly command <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nity and Love of one another to his Diſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ples in general, and more particularly to the Miniſters of his Word, as the moſt effectual Demonſtration;<note n="†" place="margin">Joh. 17.21.</note> He was ſent from God, and his Doctrin from Heaven. From whence it follows, where ever this <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is broken, Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity is liable to the Imputations of being a great Cheat and Fraud. <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>pon which advantage loathſome Irreligion enters, and ſpreads it ſelf in thoſe empty ſpaces, begotten by our Diſtan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and removes from one another: All diviſions in Chriſtianity are Scan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dals to it, and weaken it. This we ſee verified in our days; the differences in Religion, and the prophane ſcorn or ſtupid neglect of it, being alike viſible, and notorious throughout the Nation.</p>
                  <pb facs="tcp:99379:103"/>
                  <p>Yet upon juſt Accounts: the Irreli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion conſequent upon Diviſions in Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion, turns to the advantage of Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtianity, that thus it muſt be, elſe how ſhould the Scriptures be fulfilled? But this abates nothing of the Sinfulneſs and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>n<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs, or Neceſſity of Amendment.</p>
                  <p>To guide us then into that; It is ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry obſervable, the venom of this Di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtemper falls not ſo much upon the ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Parties in Religion, as upon Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion it ſelf; while we <hi>wound</hi> one ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, Religion is the <hi>Martyr,</hi> lies a bleeding, and even dying. And while good Men lament it, the Enemies of it <hi>make merry and ſend</hi>
                     <note n="†" place="margin">Rev. 11.10.</note> 
                     <hi>gifts</hi> one to another, in to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken of Triumph.</p>
                  <p>The method of Cure therefore, is not, for every Party to weigh up it ſelf, and preſs down others, but to buoy up Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion it ſelf; and that is beſt done, by Preaching and living <hi>the very Thing,</hi> without diſtinction of Names. If we did but yield it its own Integrity and <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Goodneſs, it would ſoon
<pb facs="tcp:99379:104"/> riſe into that Honour it hath loſt, by being captivated to Opinions.</p>
                  <p>For as our human Nature would be much more beautiful and happy, if cemented by that <hi>Philanthropy,</hi> or general love of Mankind, ſo indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ingly charged upon us by our Saviour; who demonſtrated, that he embraced within his own Immenſity, the whole latitude of our Nature, without con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tracting it into the narrowneſs of a human Perſon, by the great care he took; That this Nature ſhould not be diſhonoured, abuſed, and torn by it ſelf through that bitter Cenſoriouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Revenge, and Contempt, Men exerciſe upon one another, even there where Chriſt is profeſſed.</p>
                  <p>So would our Chriſtianity, that is now evil ſpoken of, appear, as it is in it ſelf, Acceptable to God, and appro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved of Men, if we could unite in thoſe comprehenſive Intereſts of Righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, Peace, Joy in the Holy-Ghoſt, that ſubſtantial Chriſtianity; Thoſe healing Wings of the Sun of Righ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teouſneſs,
<pb facs="tcp:99379:104"/> in the Rays of which our little differences about Meat and Drink would play up and down, as ſmalleſt Motes of Human Frailty, eaſily ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>taining a mutual Pardon; and that black and moſt abhorred Vapor of Ir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>religion, be forced to diſlodge at ſo Illuſtrious a Preſence.</p>
                  <p>If there be any Intereſt to keep afoot theſe Diviſions, it is an Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>reſt of Diſhonour, that dares not name it ſelf; it is not only, <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

                  <p n="3">
                     <hi>3.</hi> But to return from whence I have digreſſed, upon ſo great a Cauſe. Laſtly, we may find, in the very No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance,</hi> e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nough to defend the ſeaſonableneſs of this Diſcourſe, notwithſtanding ſpread<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Irreligion. For it imports a de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſign to Dye well: and we ſee very <hi>Few,</hi> and <hi>thoſe Few</hi> deprived of the common Modeſty and Sobriety of Man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>kind; and who thereupon become an hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rid
<pb facs="tcp:99379:105"/> Story, but dye at leaſt in a fair and calm Temper towards Religion. Now if we join to this, that of many Millions for one, every one dies as he lives, not only as the Tree falls, ſo it lies; but as it hath inclined along its growth, ſo it falls. How great is the ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſity then of living well, that we may dye well! For this <hi>Death-Bed Repentance,</hi> that riſes and ſets at the ſame time, generally proves but a falling Star. That Repentance only wheels orderly into a higher Orb, that hath given proof; it was a true Light, by ſhining here for ſome conſiderable ſpace.</p>
                  <p>A good Death receives Being from a holy Life, elſe there is not ſuch a thing in Nature, no not in Grace, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept by Miracle of Grace.</p>
                  <p>Thus far I have made Apology for the Seaſonableneſs of this Diſcourſe. In the Diſcourſe it ſelf, I am not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcious of having wandred from the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>niverſal Doctrin of Divines in this Point; except it ſhould ſeem too high a ſtrain to place this Repentance,
<pb facs="tcp:99379:105"/> (when true) among Miracles. To juſtifie that, I have the warrant of Sacred Story, <hi>the Dying Convert,</hi> which being the only Example of ſuch a one in Holy Writ, was in the days of the Meſſias, <hi>that great Period of Miracles,</hi> ſingled out upon that great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>eſt occaſion, <hi>viz.</hi> To diſplay the power of the dying Mediator, to forgive Sins, not only upon Earth, but in his loweſt Humiliation, his very deſcent into Hell; which argues it a very great Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racle.</p>
                  <p>Yet I have not trusted the weight of the Diſcourſe to any thing that looks like a private Opinion; but to moſt avowed Principles, and have therefore reſerved my particular Senſe as the Concluſion of the whole.</p>
                  <p>I have only to add, there is a Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tional late Repentance, as appears by the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſuccesfulneſs of that unparal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lell'd<note n="†" place="margin">2 Kings 23.26. and 24.3, 4.</note> Reformation of <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah;</hi> ſincere indeed in him, and of full Effect: but not in the Body of the

                  <p>THE generality of Men that have been at all acquainted with the name of Repentance, and underſtood in any Meaſure the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>portance and ſignification of the thing, acknowledge it beyond all diſpute neceſſary: Yet they allow
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99379:107"/> themſelves a leiſure for the Performance of it, and ſuch a leiſure as ſwallows the whole time of Life, and leaves only the laſt and loweſt part of it, for the diſcharge of ſo great a Buſineſs; ſo that their Repentance, if any at all, falls out to be a <hi>Death-bed Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The inconveniencies of which are unexpreſſibly great, becauſe the lives of Men are left naked of that Holineſs and Purity, that ſhould adorn them, and all over blotted with Sin and Vanity. Their Converſation wants <hi>that light of good Works, that ſhould ſhine before Men, and glorifie God in Heaven. Their Life is without form, and void, and darkneſs is upon the face of it.</hi> And in the end they are caſt upon the great Sea of Eternity, as in a Veſſel of Paper, a thin and ſuperficial Repentance.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore moſt neceſſary to uſe all means, to ſhew the Inſufficiency of this Refuge, which moſt of thoſe, that live in common under the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſion of Chriſtianity, deſign while they live to fly to when betimes they dye. To demoliſh <hi>this Houſe upon the Sand;</hi> that Men may not by hopes of ſhel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter at it, conceived long before hand, be kept off from laying <hi>their Foundation upon a Rock;</hi> which poſſibly they would do, if theſe hopes were cut off.</p>
                  <p>And becauſe this piece of Sacred Story hath been generally taken, as an Inſtance of great Favour to a late Converſion, not that it is indeed ſo, but that it ſeems to be ſo, let it be the Ground of the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Diſcourſe.</p>
                  <p>For I obſerve Divines, in their Doctrin concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the danger of a Dying Repentance, are careful to wreſt out of the hand of preſuming Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99379:107"/> this Example, and to allay the vain Confidence built upon it.</p>
                  <p>Indeed the Miſtake of it is very fatal, ſeeing if it be duly conſidered, there is nothing more forcible againſt what it is pretended for, than it. It is true, it is a Relation of a dying Man returning from great Sins to God; but ſo circumſtantiated, ſo defended on all hands againſt Boldneſs upon it, that there might have been more reaſon to hope well of Laſt-Breath-Penitencies, if there had not been a Pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern of ſuch a one in all Points, as much above the imitiation of thoſe of our days, as the Heaven is above the Earth. It is ſuch a one, as if God had ſaid of it, if I accept a Dying Repentance; be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hold this, conſider it every way, and take notice by it,<note place="margin">Ante mihi fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dem latronis oſtende, &amp; tunc tibi latronis beatitudinem policere. <hi>Auguſt.</hi>
                     </note> what a one I will have it. God putting the Caſe, and reſolving it thus, hath given a much more poſitive De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termination concerning it, than if the Caſe had never been put.</p>
                  <p>The End therefore I aim at, is to make it evident upon general Reaſons, and particularly from this Inſtance.</p>
                  <p>That a <hi>Death-bed Repentance</hi> is a hazard ſo un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakably great, that no Man can without Folly ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>treamly prodigious commit to ſo much adventure an affair of ſo great importance to an eternal condition.</p>
                  <p>Hereunto I will raiſe this Treaty by theſe degrees.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. By obſerving the Judgment of Divines con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning this Caſe, and balancing the moſt favour<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able with the more ſevere.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. By detecting the Follies that have given a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>putation to a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="4" facs="tcp:99379:108"/>
                  <p n="3">3. By examining the moſt hopeful Appearances of this kind of Repentance, and ſhewing there are plain Cauſes of them very much below the Nature of true Repentance, wherewith I will compare them.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. By obſerving the Extraordinaries, of which the Repentance of this Dying Malefactor was com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, becauſe of which it can hardly be drawn into a Precedent.</p>
                  <p>To all theſe I will ſubjoin preſſing Conſiderations on every ſide; that Men ſhould not delay their re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turn to God, to the latter Times of Life.</p>
                  <p>For the Firſt, the Judgment of Divines in the Point, I begin with that ſeverer one;<note place="margin">Dr. <hi>Taylor</hi>'s Invalidity of a late Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance.</note> yet built upon great Piety and Reaſon, that aſſerts it a plainly impoſſible thing, a Man on his Death-Bed ſhould Repent with that Repentance, the Scripture ſo oft Diſcourſes of, and promiſes Pardon to, and threatens the neglect of, with Periſhing; and there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore concludes, a Dying Man that hath not already repented, muſt needs fall, not into the Sin of Deſpair. For who is bound to hope, that hath not the reaſons of his hope given him by God? but into the Miſery of Deſpair: For how miſerable is he whom God hath left to the boiling Sea of his own Horrors, and thrown him out no Anchor of Hope?</p>
                  <p>However this Sentence ſeem rigorous, yet when we conſider the ponderous Arguments it uſes, it may rather amaze us, than provoke our Cenſure: For Firſt, it is very irreconcileable with the Glory of God, that Men who have had the knowledge of God, and been called upon all their Lives to give
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99379:108"/> up themſelves to him, ſhould be accepted, when they pour out to him the Lees and Dregs of Life, inſtead of the generous Spirits of it. That he that hath had in his Flock a Male, ſhould vow, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice to the Lord a corrupt Thing, and yet eſcape the Curſe of the Deceiver. The Expreſſions of Scripture are innumerable in which God Diſavows ſuch Proſtitutions of his Grace, (as is hereafter to be urged) but ſeals ſuch, e're they are aware, un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der Hardneſs of Heart, and a Reprobate Senſe, to Deſtruction.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It appears impoſſible, there ſhould be a diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>charge of the Duties of Repentance, when Men are a Dying; that they ſhould draw within the hollow of that little Span, that is alſo otherwiſe incumbred, the vaſtneſs of that Action, that is neceſſary to take off the Brawn of a long Impenitency.</p>
                  <p>That a Man ſhould live the life of Holineſs that is juſt a Dying; that the Tree that hath been al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways barren, ſhould bring forth good Fruit, now it is a hewing down: Theſe things are very con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tradictious; how can Repentance plant it ſelf in the Soul, and ſettle gracious habits there in ſo ſhort a ſpace? Or in an inſtant by Mortification root out thoſe Luſts, and ſinful Affections, that have been many years eating into the Heart? Repentance muſt have a time for Fruits, and thoſe Fruits for Ripening and Concoction, which a Death-Bed will not afford: So that it cannot be <hi>that Repentance of the Goſpel,</hi> but at the beſt, only ſome firſt ſtrokes of it.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There muſt be a living to God before a Man dyes to God. It is the Supream Law, every one muſt <hi>glorifie him here on Earth, and finiſh the work he hath given them to do in the World. They muſt
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99379:109"/> work the works of him that ſent them while it is day, before the night cometh, in which no Man can work.</hi> After this Men are received into the glory of God.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. In Repentance, we muſt be in the ſame Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of Temptation we were in, in the time of Sinning. But it will be hard to find in what the ſtate of a Dying Man differs from that of him, that is already dead, as to this buſineſs of Repentance; but that he may as well be allowed to Repent, that is entred into Eternity, as he that ſtands on the very brink of it.</p>
                  <p>This Cenſure cannot be injurious to Men living, and in their full Opportunity; ſuppoſe in Specula<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, it ſtretches Principles of great weight and truth too far, yet it recompenſes for it ſelf by the wholeſomneſs of it to practice; for who can ſuffer by being neceſſitated to an early Repentance, ſo much his Duty, ſo much his Safety?</p>
                  <p>Further it is moſt Prophetick, moſt undoubtedly true of moſt Mens late Repentance; That it is too ſudden, too Muſhrom a Birth to have any worthi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs in it. This Repentance almoſt univerſally wi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thers afore it grows up, and proves an Abortion; whether it comes to the tryal of a longer Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in it vaniſhes as a Cloud, and former Impiety re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>turns; or whether it paſs immediately into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity, where it ſinks down into Miſery; for attempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing the Regions of Life, and wanting the Purity that riſes thither, it is beaten back with all its Preten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions, as a Foggy Exhalation, that would climb to Heaven, but is forced down, and made to reſt be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; ſo that for the Univerſality of <hi>Death-Bed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentances</hi> this Judgment is truly calculated.</p>
                  <pb n="7" facs="tcp:99379:109"/>
                  <p>If it ſhould ſeem too Cruel to the dying Condi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, to ſmother Men alive with the ſecond Death, (as <hi>Hazael</hi> ſpread upon the dying King a thick Cloath dipped in Water) to ſtifle and benum at once all motions towards God, let us conſider what advice it offers againſt the Stupidities of Deſpair.</p>
                  <p>When we are fallen into ſo unhappy a Condition, that the whole weight of Eternity depends upon a very little Moment; it perſwades Men would do all they can in return to God, though that all muſt be truſted with the Prerogative of Mercy; for that Mercy which is ſtated in the Promiſes of the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, and is in ordinary, cannot help them in the great point of Salvation, however it may alleviate their Condemnation, and leſſen their Torment.</p>
                  <p>I mad add, if that which appears a Meſſenger of Death ſhould have ſecret reprieve in its Inſtructi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, and what ſeems a Death-bed, prove only a Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cipline: It may be a happy beginning of a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to him, who lives, after his being near the Grave, to perfect it, according to that of <hi>Job,</hi> 33. <hi>ver.</hi> 22, 23.</p>
                  <p>Thus this Opinion doth not cut off the Action of its deſperate Perſon; and if by that Action, he paſs <hi>the needles Eye,</hi> and get through the <hi>ſtrait Gate</hi> of Repentance and Regeneration, it will be able to give him no Reſiſtance: For thoſe to whom the <hi>two-leav'd Gates</hi> of Faith and Repentance open, this Air of Diſcourſe cannot bar, that they ſhould not enter into life.</p>
                  <p>But on the other ſide, they that are confident, and make themſelves ſure of Repentance and Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; cannot when they meet the ſolid Obſtacles of things, force their way by the Breath of their Mouth;
<pb n="8" facs="tcp:99379:110"/> but they and their intended Repentance are together locked up in the cloſeneſs and compactedneſs of thoſe Decrees; Firſt; They cannot Repent, Then they cannot be Saved.</p>
                  <p>To conclude; let ſuch a Deciſion of this Caſe be never ſo auſtere, it is a thouſand times more Juſt than the delay of our return to God in the Contem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plation of doing it at the laſt can be; and the Rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſons upon which it is planted, are ſuch, that though they may not reach the height deſigned, yet do they exclude thouſands from Eternal Happineſs; and although they may not make good the Comple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of the Cenſure, yet are they of ſo awful a regard, and ſo worthy of all Obſervation, that they are moſt vehemently to be preſſed to the main ſcope; that Men would by no means truſt to this Extreme Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, to which purpoſe I ſhall hereafter take further advantage of them.</p>
                  <p>But let us come to that tenderer apprehenſion of the generality of Divines, with which I will con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cur, that all things of Opinion and Diſpute may be taken away in ſo great a Point. Let it then be allowed, that a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance</hi> is no im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſſibility.</p>
                  <p>Firſt, in regard of infinite Mercy, that cannot be limited, but by it ſelf: Now long Impenitency, though it be often doomed irrevocably by God in particular Generations of Men, or Perſons; yet is not that Sin, that <hi>ſhall never be forgiven.</hi> Nor is it upon that account, that the Scripture ſaith of ſome; <hi>It is impoſſible to renew them to Repentance.</hi> So that though there be many Examples of ſuch Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>penitency, that have proved in the Event unpardon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>
                     <gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>ble, yet not from the preciſe Nature of the thing
<pb n="9" facs="tcp:99379:110"/> it ſelf: We may rather believe, that as the unmea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſurable Being of God hath delighted it ſelf in ſo ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny varieties and gradations of the Creatures down from Angels to the darkeſt foot-ſteps of himſelf in the World; ſo the unſearchable Riches of his Grace are made known in all kinds of Pardons. As there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it hath choſen ſome of the worſt of Sinners for the ſorts of their Sins, chiefeſt of Sinners, and brought them home; ſo ſome that have made the utmoſt adventure of continuance in Sin, that in theſe manifold Glaſſes it might be ſeen, <hi>Where Sin hath abounded, Grace hath abounded much more.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. Though the time of this Repentance be ſhort and narrow, and the Duties of Repentance exceed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing long and broad; yet where there are found the true ſignatures of Repentance unfeigned, God be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>holds the Fruit in the Seed and Root, he knows the Perfection of his own Creation, though Infant, or we may conceive ſuch <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> in Repentance, Repentance born out of due time, as <hi>Paul</hi> was in the Apoſtleſhip, ſuddenly accompliſhed, though they had not the regular time of forming, like <hi>a Nation brought forth in a day.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">
                        <hi>Cyprian</hi> de coena Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mini.</note>
                     <q>Thus thou Lord anointeſt in a Moment Herdſmen into Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phets, Shepherds into Kings, Publicans thou ordaineſt Apo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtles, nor doth their Diſeaſe take leiſure to remove, whom thou recovereſt, but in that very Moment thou makeſt them every whit whole, wherein they have thee for their Phyſician.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Although there be according to the general Rule, a neceſſity of living to God here in the World; yet God may diſpenſe with the Continuation, or
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:99379:111"/> drawing out of the Action of it in theſe late Peni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tents, as we eaſily allow in the caſe of Infants, or Men dying within ſhort ſpace after a Repentance begun upon ſad Conſideration, and not in the Exigency of a Sickneſs.</p>
                  <p>In the mean time, it is not at all ſuppoſed, that God diſpenſes with the ſincere Preparations and Reſolvedneſs of the Mind to that Action; but that they muſt be moſt true, ſound and unfeigned, and the very Action it ſelf, according to the time, high, full and moſt ſignificant; and as extraordinary as the Repentance it ſelf.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Although the Condition of a Dying Man do in many regards nearly reſemble the ſtate of him, that is already in Eternity, as he is under a neceſſity of leaving Sin and the World, and ſet at a diſtance from Temptation; yet it differs in that great Circumſtance, that he is not <hi>in Termino,</hi> he is not fixt upon his un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>changeable Point, he hath not undergone that Sen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence that immediately paſſes upon the Soul removed, and ſo may not either have ſuffered that more ſecret one, conceived by God upon long Provocation. The whole time of Life may be a time of Grace, and he that hath not yet been concluded by the incommutability of Eterni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty may hear the Voice of Chriſt, and enter into his Reſt.<note n="*" place="margin">Quando iſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>hinc exceſſum fuerit, nullus jam poeniten<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiae locus.

                  <p>But that a dying Repentance in the nature of the thing is no Incompoſſibility, we have fulleſt Aſſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rance in the Example of the Text, wherein we ſee one in a moment conceived, brought forth, and even a grown Man in Repentance, one paſſing through ſome ſhort Inſtants of holy Action, and entring into Paradiſe, like <hi>Aaron</hi>'s Rod budding, bloſſoming, and bringing forth ripe Almonds in a Night, and laid up in the Sanctuary for ever.</p>
                  <p>That it was moſt probably the firſt Call he had to Repentance, agrees fully with the Intention of my Diſcourſe, which granting ſo much as a Poſſibility, would yet take all advantage againſt the eaſie Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence

And though it is true, the Spirit of God is not hindered in its Inſpirations, but that it bloweth where it liſteth; yet the courſe of it is ſo attemper'd to the ſtate and motion of the Soul it ſelf, that it moſt uſually takes the opportunity ſo generally requiſite to the ſetling a Conſtitution and Temper in us; that is; the freeſt and moſt unpreju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diced, and larger ſpaces of a Man's Life: So that whenever it works upon Dying Men, I mean thoſe that have had the free uſe of the means of Grace of old; It works by ſuch a Prerogative, that a Man may as well expect a Prerogative of Providence to bear him walking upon the Sea, becauſe it did once ſo to <hi>Peter,</hi> as this.</p>
                  <p>Moſt even of the faireſt Appearances of this kind of Repentance miſcarry, having no true Virtue in them; and though in regard of their vehemency they are called early Seekings of God, yet (which is horrible to be ſpoken) they are as it were prepa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red for the Triumphs of the Juſtice and Indignation of God over thoſe,<note place="margin">

                  <p>And now when this Judgment of Divines with this Ballance upon it is compared with the former, the reſult will be only this, the kindeſt Divinity in the point, and that ſeems to do the moſt favor, is very dreadful, and leaves ſuch Men in a Condition next to deſperate, which is but an Aggravation of the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger, when what Men would chooſe to appeal to, ſo far condemns them.</p>
                  <p>It is then agreed on all hands, that for any Man to live ſo as if he did contrive and forecaſt a Dying Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance (altho it be yielded him, it is no impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity) as the ſafe expedient, firſt of an Irreligious Life, free from the troubleſome Thoughts of a preſent Amendment, and then of a ſecure Paſſage into Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nity; It is firſt an exceeding Irreligion and Immorality in it ſelf; and then to run ſo deſperate a Riſque and Adventure for an Immortal Soul; that he is a par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>donable Mad-man, in compariſon of ſuch an one, that drinks a deadly Poyſon, becauſe he hath heard there is a certain Antidote in the World, that will expel it, though he cannot tell whether he can have it at all, much leſs whether time enough for his neceſſity; and laſtly, whether the Endeavors he uſes for it will not be deluded with the Counterfeits of it, it being ſuppoſed they are thouſands for one of the true kind; and he thereby periſh, pleaſing himſelf with the hopes he hath it, when he hath indeed but a like<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. <hi>Head.</hi> I come now to the ſecond Propoſal, which is to make inquiry, ſeeing the Caſe is thus, as it every way appears to be, How the name or notion of a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance,</hi> as ſuch an univerſal Refuge, came up in the World; for it is a new Repentance, (<hi>much like thoſe new-come-up
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99379:114"/> Gods Moſes</hi> ſpeaks of, <hi>Deut.</hi> 32.17.) that Chriſtianity and the Goſpel know not. The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures that treat moſt profeſſedly of Repentance, al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ways inſiſt upon it as a reformed courſe of Life, to be undertaken even now, while the Propoſals of Grace and Reconciliation are made to us; and only by very ſilent Intimations, the track of which is hard<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly diſcerned, leave it poſſible, that God ſhould by miracle ſave ſome very few out of the Fire, and pull them as Brands out of the Burning, by giving them Repentance at the laſt. Whereas this is now become the only Repentance in uſe, and hath devoured the other; as if to preſs Men upon it were to torment them before their time, and to leſſen the Validity of this were to take away the Mercy of God, and deny the Grace that is ſo free and univerſal. Let us ſearch therefore how this ſort of Repentance hath come into ſuch Repute. And if we obſerve, we ſhall find it firſt riſing from the intimate Senſe the Conſcience hath of the neceſſity of Repentance; For were it not ſo clear and evident a Duty, <hi>a Death-Bed Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance</hi> had never been heard of; moſt would chooſe to go out of the World as they have lived in it, not ſuffering any degree of the trouble of Conſcience, or vexing themſelves with Reflections upon an unholy and ill-ſpent Life. As Men have choſe to live freely and uninterruptedly in forgetfulneſs of God, and an Eternal Condition <hi>days without number,</hi> Jer. 2.32. ſo would they chooſe to die, were there not a Law within, that however it hath lain covered with the Duſt of Senſuality, yet is now reſtored to its Autho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and urges the Soul with the Terror of Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment for ſo long Diſobedience.</p>
                  <pb n="17" facs="tcp:99379:114"/>
                  <p>And ſecondly, this neceſſity of Repentance, though ſecretly underſtood, yet was not ſufficiently conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dered in the time of Health, for had it been equally regarded, it had not been now to begin. He that had rightly meaſured it, would not for a thouſand Worlds ſo have adjourned it.</p>
                  <p>Theſe two things then meeting ſo oft together, <hi>viz.</hi> The neceſſity of Repentance; and the neglect of it all along our Life: the neceſſity it ſhould be performed ſome time, ere Men go out of the World; and the neglect of it in the freer Opportunities of Life; Theſe, I ſay, bring forth haſty motions of it at laſt: For it loſing nothing of its neceſſity by its delay, it muſt be done, as well as it may be at that time; even as the laſt Moments, wherein Buſineſſes of great Conſequence are to be diſpatched, preſs for Expedition the more earneſtly, becauſe they muſt be done then or never, though it often falls out, the time is ſo far paſt, they ſuffer not only much diſad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantage, but even defeat by the delay.</p>
                  <p>The Notion of a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance</hi> then we may perceive riſing from the great Indiſpoſition to Repent, while the Pleaſures of Sin are in their Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon, and flouriſh, and Men in Health and Strength to enjoy them; and from the neceſſities of Repentance falling upon them at the laſt, and wringing from them ſometimes very high Acknowledgments of God and an Eternal Condition, paſſionate Expreſſions of the folly, evil and vanity of former Life, deſires of Mercy, Profeſſions of ſtrong Reſolvedneſs to ſerve God, and if they had many Lives to give God, they would give them all. All which being ſo unuſual to hear formerly out of ſuch Mouths, and coming from Dying Men, for whoſe Sayings we have a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99379:115"/> regard, Charity towards them, and willingneſs to hope well of them, gives theſe Semblances, the Reputation of Repentance. To which may be ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, That thoſe who are Guides and Seers in Reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gion too often, <hi>errante Clave,</hi> by too Liberal an Ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolution open the Kingdom of Heaven to ſuch, and taking the Inſtruments of a fooliſh Shepherd to themſelves, heal the hurt of their Souls ſlightly; ſo that their Repentance is ſaincted here, and though it miſcarry in the other World, yet the miſcarriage is hid alſo in that other World.</p>
                  <p>From all this hath ariſen a down-right Opinion of this kind of Repentance, as the only <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                        <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                     </gap> the Prudent Expedient, that compounds two ſo dif<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferent Intereſts, firſt that of a worldly Converſation, to which it gives no hinderance; then that of Eter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal Life in appearance, becauſe it aſſumes the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſes of Mercy to it ſelf, eſpecially thoſe gracious Aſſurances in <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18. <hi>Chap.</hi> 33. it reckons as made on purpoſe for it. All which argues a very vile Senſe both of the Juſtice and Mercy of God; of his Juſtice as if it had no authority, of his Mercy as if it had no ſenſe of Honour.</p>
                  <p>And laſtly it is grown into a general Expectation, rhat however ill and careleſly of God Men have lived here, yet they ſhould go out of the World with good words of him and Religious Profeſſions, as an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>balm to their Memory and a Dirge to their Souls in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to the Happineſs of an Everlaſting Condition.</p>
                  <p>Thus they call Repentance and Heaven <hi>after their own name. This their way is their folly;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Pſal. 49.11.13, 14, &amp;c.</note> 
                     <hi>yet their Poſterity, men of like Inclinations, approve their ſayings;</hi> becauſe ſuch Men <hi>(as
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99379:115"/> they ſpeak)</hi> go away like Lambs, <hi>but as the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture ſays, like ſenſleſs Sheep are laid in the Grave, and Death feeding upon them,</hi> the Error is not diſcovered <hi>till the morning: when the upright have dominion over them;</hi> that is, infinitely excel them, and their counterfeit Repentance, <hi>which can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not ſtand in judgment, nor they in the congregation</hi> of ſincere Penitents, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 5.</p>
                  <p>Now this account I have given of a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance</hi> obtaining among us, is too comprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſive; yet I muſt acknowledge, that there are many whoſe Judgments are more enlightned, and the Senti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments of their Conſciences quicker than to be ſatisfi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed at ſo eaſie a rate, who yet fall into the common unhappineſs of not having repented, till they come to die: I will therefore enquire further, why many who are able to feel before-hand the neceſſities of a ſpeedy Repentance, and alſo to draw their Death ſo near them, as to die daily in the ſenſe of Death; and thereby further perceive thoſe Neceſſities, do not yet Repent daily, but betray themſelves to an <hi>Even<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing or Twilight Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>The Reſolution of this lies not only in the immo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derate love of Sin and its Pleaſures, and the too low apprehenſion of God and Eternal Things, (though theſe are always preſent in the caſe) but chiefly it lies in the great Confidence ſuch Men have in the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent time, not ſenſible of the continual waſte of it; Under the favour of which they <hi>put away the evil day far from them, and ſtretch themſelves</hi> upon this moment, <hi>Amos</hi> 6.3. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> that they may take their full Eaſe and Satisfaction: In the mean while ſtifling the Thoughts of Dying and Judgment. Were it not for this, no other Reaſon would encourage them to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay
<pb n="20" facs="tcp:99379:116"/> their Repentance; for when this Fails, all others generally fail alſo, and therefore none are ſo paſſio<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nately moved, as ſuch, when they come to die.</p>
                  <p>This Cloud that is but as big as a Man's hand (<hi>our days are as an hands breadth,</hi> Pſal 39.6.) yet looks like the whole Heaven; It ſtands as a Firmament over their heads, It looks like an Eternity to Men. In this time Repentance finds as little place with them, as it is like to do with God in the Evening of Life.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>In this occaſion the wild Aſſes of the Wilderneſs ſnuff up the wind at their pleaſure, and none can turn them,</hi> Jer. 2.24. <hi>The luſt of the Fleſh, the luſt of the Eye, and the pride of Life</hi> ſwallow all and can ſpare nothing; Yet in the midſt of all this the Soul promiſes it ſelf, it will ere long take a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of recollecting it ſelf, and that it will do it time enough, ſo timely as to leave ſpace ſufficient for a large Exerciſe of Repentance; for although it is but upon the edges and skirts of Time, yet it ſeems to it ſelf to be upon the Center, and in its Imagination commands the future, as if it were in its own hand; ſo that through the endleſs returns of Pleaſure and Buſineſs, through Indiſpoſedneſs to holy and ſerious Action, through Intentions and Purpoſes of being better hereafter, it ſlips down, e're ever it is aware, into the loweſt of Life, and hath the buſineſs of Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance lying whole and undiminiſhed upon its hand: <hi>Yet a little ſleep, a little ſlumber, a little fold<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the hands to ſleep, deceives men, till their laſt end comes as an armed man,</hi> Prov. 24.12. The hopes that <hi>to morrow will be as to day, and much more abundant,</hi> Iſa. 56.12. ſo as to leave enough for ſadder Thoughts, befools Men, till the very Courſe of Time rows them before they think of it upon Eternity.</p>

This Vapor ſtretches out it ſelf as far as it can: <hi>It rejoices in its own boaſtings which are evil,</hi> Jam. 4.16. In the mean while the Moments of it are winged, and fly from us; they glide away, and we cannot, ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cept we bring them to ſtrict Account, take hold of them to graft any thing upon them: How does to day like <hi>an Egale, or Poaſt, or ſwift Ship, or Arrow</hi> get from us, <hi>leaving no path?</hi> Wiſd. 5.9, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> And if we offer to take the Account, how many things ſnatch it from us, as an impertinent Diſturber from him that is catching ſlippery numbers? <hi>Here is Wiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom, let him that hath it count the number of Life, for it is the number of a Man,</hi> Rev. 13.18. A ſhort number. <hi>It is all but Dying Man,</hi> Eccl. 6.10. And yet it requires great Ingenuity, The Ingenuity of a Man, <hi>that is indeed a Man,</hi> to find it: But he that miſſes it, is found <hi>at the end of his days a Fool,</hi> and finds that <hi>dreadful reward of a Fool,</hi> Jer. 17.11.

                  <p>Thus far I have inſiſted upon the Accounts, how this <hi>Baptiſm of Repentance for the Dead,</hi> 1 Cor. 15.29. came in upon Chriſtianity, that is, How it comes to paſs that Men will not be <hi>baptiſed with this Baptiſm</hi> till they are given over for dead Men, like thoſe <hi>Clinici</hi> of the firſt Times, that delay'd their Baptiſm to their laſt Bed, of whom ſome Expound

                  <p>But the Miſtake in this Caſe (though that paſſed not without ſome note of Diſgrace) is in a point of much higher Conſequence, and ſo far more dange<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rous, and hath alſo leſs of reaſonable Pretence; for while they thought, Baptiſm waſhed away all paſt Sins, and was but once to be done; it ſeemed a ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary Providence to take the full Benefit of it at the laſt, upon which account <hi>Tertullian</hi> even Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſtulates, <hi>Quorſum feſtinat innocens aetas ad re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſionem peccatorum?</hi> while he Diſcourſes of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fant-Baptiſm.</p>
                  <p>Whereas the <hi>Water of Repentance is never for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bidden,</hi> Acts 10.47. but may be both evenly drawn through the whole courſe of Life, and often renewed to ſupply the Defects of it ſelf; which is one Signification of that <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">

Nor do I indeed doubt, but the Water of Baptiſm, wherever it hath effect, as a Spring, that from the firſt Moment wherein it is truly received, runs down with a free Current upon the whole Courſe of Life, and is therefore univerſally<note n="*" place="margin">Operatur in Baptiſmo poeni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentia, tan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quam in fun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>damento. <hi>Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>guſt.</hi> Expoſ.

                  <p>But to return: Although theſe Accounts I have now given of a <hi>Death-bed Repentance,</hi> obtaining among us, infold the whole Multitude of dying Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nitents,
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99379:117"/> yet according to the former ſtate given I do not deny, but that ſome very rare Example there may be, giving a better Senſe to this ſort of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; Examples of the Grace of God, acting in a way of Prerogative, as hath been ſaid, and working effectually the truth of Repentance in ſome; upon whom he lays the hand of his Salvation and Reſcue, while they ſtand upon the very laſt minutes of the Seaſon of Grace, and are juſt dropping down into Hell; and guides them to take their Lateſt ſteps in the ways of Life, wherein they had hitherto been ſtrangers; upon whom a great Miracle is wrought, that they ſhould in their almoſt perfected motion to endleſs Ruin be ſtopt, and when they had juſt finiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed their Courſe thither, they ſhould yet be tranſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>planted into the way Everlaſting.</p>
                  <p>But I proceed to the Third Head. To examine the moſt hopeful appearances of this kind of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and to ſhew there are plain Cauſes of them, much below the nature of true Repentance.</p>
                  <p>And firſt in the general: It is no wonderful thing to find Men in a Paroxyſm, in a high Paſſion of ſeeking after God, when they are a Dying.

<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99379:118"/> 
                     <hi>pulled up by the roots,</hi> there's nothing to quicken or move in them. This is amazing Stupor: <hi>They die like a ſtone,</hi> Exod. 15.5. 1 Sam. 25.37. they plunge down with the whole weight and force of Impenitency.</p>
                  <p>This way of Dying hath certainly greater Puniſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, and heavier Condemnation; and though it ſeem more chooſeable than a fruitleſs Repentance, yet doubtleſs Eternity makes a difference, though not ſuch an one, as ſhould give any one Confidence to imbarque into it in a <hi>Coffin-Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But whether it be rather to be choſen or not, this is paſt queſtion; It is unavoidable to ſome; whether they will or no they are ſurprized with Thoughts, what will become of them for ever, and few Men but have thoughts this way at ſuch a time above ordinary.</p>
                  <p>But I intend to ſpeak of the faireſt and beſt ſpread Repentance that is found upon a Death-bed. That which gives the livelieſt Hopes of it ſelf, that it is true and ſincere; not ſuch an one that to a ſerious Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerver betrays it ſelf; not either that forced compo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure, to the Expectation of the World, which looks for a ſolemn Profeſſion of God from every one that dies; nor an ignorant and formal Repentance; but a Repentance that hath much of Vigor, and inward Affection, and is driven on by great knowledge and light; that is accompanied with much Sorrow, and very conſiderate Apprehenſions of Eternal Things: And if ſuch an one be ſo queſtionable, what can be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>come of others?</p>
                  <p>There is no reaſon any Repentance ſhould be the better eſteemed becauſe Men are Dying, but much the leſs. Now while Men are living a thouſand of theſe ſeeming Changes for the better, are evidently
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:99379:118" rendition="simple:additions"/> confuted without more ado, by after returns to Wickedneſs; and they that have to do with ſuch ſhews of Reformation, have no regard of them, nor of the Perſons for them.<note place="margin">Apud illum Cordis Inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pretem Ars non admittitur ad ſalutem. <hi>Auguſt.</hi> Serm. <hi>120.</hi>
                     </note> Now God, who is the exact Searcher of Hearts, can much leſs be impoſed upon by the faireſt appearances; nor can Men wiſe according to the Rules of Scripture be eaſily well perſwaded of them, and when they are beſt perſwaded, there muſt needs be a very trembling Conſideration of ſo great a hazard.</p>
                  <p>But to come more particularly to what I have pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſed, <hi>viz.</hi> To ſhew that Repentance is a Height, to which theſe general Motives of this late Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance can never mount the Soul. In which I will begin with the Deſcriptions of true Repentance, in that wherein it is moſt difficult (not to ſay impoſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ble) to riſe to it upon a Dying Bed.</p>
                  <p>Repentance in all the parts of it, is the fulleſt, cleareſt act of the Soul and Judgment, wherein it is moſt perfectly it ſelf. Remove a Man never ſo far from all kind of Fears, from the Appearances of Death, if he were to live Ages, he would be of the ſame Senſe.

Repentance en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters as a Soul into theſe, which is a ſtill, ſolid, clear Act of Reaſon renewed, and a Mind which gives an uniform Vote at all times. A Change that is never changed back again, no more than things can put off themſelves, or evil it ſelf become good. It is therefore upon fulleſt Deliberation to chooſe with <hi>Joſhuah, I and my houſe,</hi> thoſe whom <hi>I</hi> can govern, <hi>will ſerve the Lord,</hi> Joſh. 24.15. It is <hi>Engaging the Heart to approach to God, the joining our ſelves to him by an everlaſting Covenant, never to be forgot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten,</hi> Jer. 30.21. and 50.5. <hi>The cleaving to him with full purpoſe of Heart,</hi> Acts 11.23. When all forerunning Affections are laid and quiet, or worn out, this Judgment ſtill remains, and raiſeth other Affections like it ſelf, that ever remain with it; into which the Spirits of the former are extracted, and wherein they exerciſe all the true power they had. But now on a Death-bed there is often a great Commotion raiſed, a loud bluſtre of Paſſion never arriving at this point, at this Settlement: But if a Man ſhould live after, it would go off, as Clouds and Storms, that when they have ſpent themſelves, va<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſh and lie down: And when a Man dies, it is to
<pb n="27" facs="tcp:99379:119"/> be fear'd, that as they were raiſed by approach to the unappeaſable Tempeſts of Darkneſs, ſo they are hurried with their Violence.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is carefully to be obſerved, that there is in true Repentance a due Proportion betwixt the con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trite Indignation of the Soul againſt paſt Sin, and the love and zeal it hath for Holineſs: whereas in <hi>Death-bed Repentances,</hi> it is ofteneſt found, that there is either a terrifying Preſence only of former Sins, ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pearing to the affrighted Conſcience, without a more hopeful Indication of the Soul truly compoſed to Righteouſneſs: or elſe ſome high flying Reſolutions of better Life afterward, offered, as a kind of Bribe to the Patience and Mercy of God, in hopes of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent Deliverance, or at beſt, as a Ranſom from Hell and Eternal Damnation; but without a deep ſenſe of the guilt and evil of paſt Sins, or the juſt appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſion of that continually running iſſue of Corrup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, that is ſtill defiling anew: Either of theſe is a main Error, and pernicious; For if on the one ſide the Heart in a Rage be forced to caſt out ſome Sins for the turbulency of them, if it be not imme<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>diately filled with better Gueſts, <hi>Seven other Spirits are ready to enter, and make the laſt ſtate of that Man worſe than the firſt,</hi> Mat. 12.43. For Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance is no void ſpace, no ſilent, or unactive ſtate, but when it hath diſlodged Luſts, furniſhes and fills the Soul with the beſt things, and carries the vigor of a Man's Action to the beſt effect; <hi>When by re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance a Man ceaſes to do evil, he learns to do Well,</hi> Iſai. 1.16, 17. <hi>And brings forth fruits meet for repentance, and amendment of life,</hi> Mat. 3.8.</p>
                  <p>On the other ſide, he that ſeems to make a haſty motion to Holineſs without due ſenſe of Sin, firſt
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99379:120"/> thinks to overrule the method God hath ſet, who requires Humiliation, godly Sorrow, Anger, Revenge, Fear, as preparing to Repentance: And further, he conceits a freedom to himſelf, when he is fetter'd and bound; without a power given him from God, he offers to caſt out <hi>Devils with eaſe, that cannot be caſt out, but by faſting and prayer,</hi> Mark 9.29. (that is) ſevere courſes of Self-abaſement, and low<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lieſt dependences together with earneſteſt Applica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to the Grace of God. Theſe unclean Spirits therefore, that diſſemble a retreat, return immediately, and make a Prey of the deluded Soul, <hi>Acts</hi> 19.14, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. Although Heaven and Hell, Happineſs and Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſery, take up the thoughts of a true Penitent, yet not ſeparated from God and Chriſt, but as it were compounded into the Senſe of God angry, and the deſire of Attonement with him in <hi>Jeſus Christ.</hi> Hap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pineſs and Miſery conſidered apart are not the ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ject of the gracious Soul: But God and Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered apart are an infinitely ſufficient Reaſon of Repentance. The clear love of God upwards the Soul, as a Father in Chriſt without Reflections upon Happineſs, is, though not the ſingle, yet the para<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mount Conſideration in Repentance unfeigned. But Men a Dying are generally ſo over-poſſeſſed with the Terrors of an Eternal Suffering, and meer deſires of Freedom from pain; and of well-being, and ſo in haſte, that they generally miſs theſe higher Conſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derations, which being further off, not only from corrupt Nature, but even from natural Conſcience, are not commonly eſpied, but therefore argue great<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Sincerity, and truth of Heart.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. The trueſt Repentance lies in the boſom of Faith, the apprehenſions of the Love and Goodneſs
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99379:120"/> of God in Chriſt melt the Soul, and give it moſt perfect Separation from Sin, the moſt effectual Pu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rification of the Heart; all which expreſs the height of Repentance. Upon the ſoft Fire of the pardoning Goodneſs of God, the Soul moſt kindly diſtils into repentant Tears. Here flows that Spirit of Grace, and ingenuous Goodneſs, which bringeth forth the cleareſt and holieſt Affection towards God.</p>
                  <p>But at the time we are now ſpeaking of; It is very ſeldom, that either Horror or Preſumption do not ſwallow all: Preſumption, where there is little Senſe or Judgment of the Caſe; Horror, where the Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment is clearer and the Senſe quicker; for evey thing diſpoſes now rather to Fear, <hi>and to the Spirit of Bon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dage,</hi> Rom. 8.15. and a Man naturally does all he does under a ſervile dread of God, and his Eternal Juſtice, And though there may be much mention of Chriſt, and deſire of Mercy through him; yet it is but as a Malefactor convicted, beſeeches the Mercy of the Judge, no otherwiſe than as of a Judge: So ſuch call out for the Mercy of God to par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don them, but ſtill as a Judge, not with the <hi>Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of the Son ſent into the Heart, the Spirit of Adoption crying Abba, Father.</hi> Nor <hi>with that love that caſteth out unworthy Fear,</hi> Gal. 4.6. And in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed how can it be otherwiſe, there having been <hi>no acquaintance with God in the way,</hi> Job 22.21. but a long Enmity; and the time now too ſtrait for a free and full Conſideration of the riches of Grace, ſuch as may ſtill an awakened Conſcience: Fear preſſes in every way, and ſhuts out Faith. What can now redeem the Soul from this helliſh Terror, but a light from Heaven immediately darting into it, a Grace above that Grace, that ordinarily ſaves Men? For a
<pb n="30" facs="tcp:99379:121"/> well ſetled Truſt and Confidence in Mercy according to the general Rule, is not, but after ſome ſad de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bates, and experimental Conſultations, that have paſſed between the ſenſe of Sin, and the affiancing Acts of the Soul upon Chriſt. This Repentance then is in great danger of miſſing the Spirit of the Goſpel, and falling into the Rank of thoſe Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tances of <hi>Cain, Eſau, Judas.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>This I have endeavoured to ſhew, that though we ſuppoſe a Dying Man to ſpread his Soul and Thoughts every way, and to all the parts of Repentance; yet it is extremely to be ſuſpected, there will want the true and right quality of them; in regard of the ve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry diſadvantageous Circumſtances, wherein ſuch an one is found; and the great unfitneſs of the Soul at that time, to begin to do anything worthy, to which it hath not been before inured; or if it did begin, it would be much more unlikely <hi>to bring forth fruit</hi> (as our Saviour ſpeaks) <hi>to perfection,</hi> Luke 8.14.</p>
                  <p>I add nothing of the Exerciſes of a full and well grown Repentance, whereby it is daily eſpying the riſings of Sin, and ſuppreſſing them, and filling up the Defects of Holineſs and Obedience; becauſe they are not to be thought poſſible in the point I am now ſpeaking of, and I have already given a Reſolution in that Caſe.</p>
                  <p>I ſhall now ſet my ſelf to find out the low Cauſes, that are alway to be ſuſpected to have the great In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fluence upon ſuch a <hi>Latter-end Penitency.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>In general therefore, we muſt take notice, that there are ſeveral vapors of miſapprehenſion, riſing upon the Soul, when we are a Dying, that do ſo diſguiſe it to it ſelf, and disfigure the true face of it, that from thence ariſe dangerous Miſtakes concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing a Mans Condition towards God.</p>
                  <pb n="31" facs="tcp:99379:121"/>
                  <p>We ſee into how many ſhapes upon ordinary Oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currences we change, and how eaſily we exchange them for quite different, without any good Cauſe; what continual Ebbs and Flows there are of the Hu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mours, and how do theſe caſt the Ballance of the Superiour Soul? One Man is every hour ſome ſeveral ſorts of Men.</p>
                  <p>How much more do great Accidents, and removes out of one Condition into another, alter us? Which yet are but the ſudden and juſt now ſtate of our Minds upon ſuch Alterations, which not continuing we return to our former Figure, <hi>
                        <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nſtable and weak as water,</hi> Gen. 49.3. we take the form of every Veſſel we are put into. Who knows then whether his Dying Repentance be any more than the Mould, not of his Mind, but of his Dying Condition approaching him big, with ſo great a Change? We know many things befal us in our Lives, which put a greater ſenſe of Religion upon us, than we find at other times; and yet how variable are we? <hi>our goodneſs at ſuch times is as the Morning Dew, and as the early Dew it goeth away,</hi> Hoſe. 6.4. How often are we from the occaſions of Mercies, Afflictions, Fears, Hopes, good Diſcourſes, carried into high Apprehen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſions of God? And we loſe them again we know not how: Now out of doubt a Dying Condition of any thing we meet with in the World is moſt apt to move us upon God, and a Senſe of him. But can we think, Thoſe fleeting Shoots of the Soul, that have no certainty, are accepted for Repentance?</p>
                  <p>How ſtrangely doth Melancholly, and Oppreſſions of that transform Men? which when it falls upon the Motions of Conſcience, gives us ſtrong Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of Eternal Things; which yet being nothing
<pb n="32" facs="tcp:99379:122"/> but the caſt of that Melancholly upon the Thoughts; when that is removed, they are quite of another hue.</p>
                  <p>It is evident the Mind ſees much through the Bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy, and the Repreſentations are coloured by its Temper. As the Eye ſees through yellow or green Glaſs, differently from the things themſelves: So the Serenity or Cloudineſs of the Humours makes a different Reflection of things upon the Mind, and the livelineſs or heavineſs of the Spirits incline us to very varying Apprehenſions.</p>
                  <p>Now what time is more like to be ſo incumber'd with theſe Clouds and Vapours than a Dying Hour? When every thing is ready to contribute them, and nothing to ſcatter them? If then Natural Conſcience, and implanted Senſe of God together with the No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions given us from Scripture paſs through theſe, they become very impreſſive, and affecting for the time; and yet he much miſtakes Repentance, who thinks it no more, than a fit of Religious Melancholly.</p>
                  <p>But let us enquire after ſome more ſetled, and conſtant Cauſes of theſe Penitential Motions near Death, and we ſhall find many very likely to be ſo, that are not yet worthy of true Repentance, and therefore what ſprings from them, is not accepted before God.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. When Men find all their Being in the World at an end, and feel themſelves falling, they know not whither; It is no ſtrange thing they ſhould catch at God, and that they may take hold of him, at Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lineſs alſo; Seeing ingraffed Principles together with general Diſcourſe teach every one, how dear Holineſs is to God.</p>
                  <p>If God and Goodneſs were no more than Imagina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry things: It would be no wonder, if they who are
<pb n="33" facs="tcp:99379:122"/> toſſed off the World, and thrown over-board from it, ſhould ſnatch at them; if there were no more in the Caſe than this, that every one hath heard ſo much ſpeech, and talk of them among Men. For to him that hath nothing in reality, even a Shadow, a Phan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy are valuable. Men that are dropping through the Air, or ſinking under Water, without Conſulta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion offer at every thing they meet with.</p>
                  <p>In great Extremities ſhort of Death, they that are bereft of all worldly Aſſiſtance, fly to the Divine Succours, though as <hi>Jonah</hi>'s Marriners they pray to an Idol inſtead of the true God, and their Devoti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on is no better than Superſtition, which is but a Phancy in Religion. What ſtrange thing then is it, for nature to cry out for God, and Chriſt, for Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don of Sin, to be delivered from Hell, and to have Heaven for an everlaſting Reſt, when all things elſe evidently fail as they do in Death; and when not only Phancy, and general Opinion, but moſt ſub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtantial Reaſon inlightned by the Scripture provoke up a Man to it, even for Self-preſervation?</p>
                  <p>Yet this differs but little <hi>from howling upon our Beds for Corn, and Wine, and Oyl,</hi> Hoſ. 7.14. for though the things differ much in their Nature, yet the Eſteem Men have of them, and the deſire they have after them is much upon the ſame ground; for theſe Spiritual things appear to that natural Senſe of Self-preſervation, as neceſſary in Death, as the other do in Life and Health.</p>
                  <p>But if the approaches of Death happen to be again drawn off, the value of Spiritual things removes with them, and the things of this World, with all the ſenſual and ſinful Delights of it, return to their former price: which argues the ineffectualneſs of
<pb n="34" facs="tcp:99379:123"/> this cauſe of Repentance, and the Unacceptableneſs of the Repentance it ſelf to God, that flows from it; God diſclaims Men, that have never come to him before their Extremity, and come then only becauſe of it. <hi>In the time of their trouble they will ſay, Ariſe, and ſave us: But where are thy Gods that thou madeſt? Let them ariſe if they can ſave thee,</hi> Jer. 2.27, 28. Thus to ſuch Dying Men crying out to him, God ſays, Let your former Luſts and Plea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſures now be your Happineſs. <hi>Fools and ſcorners,</hi> that would not be warned, <hi>call upon God in their calamity, and ſeek him early, when the whirlwind of their deſtructions hurries them, but cannot make him hear, cannot find him,</hi> Prov. 1.14.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Suppoſe the deſires after God, and Eternal Happineſs, with all the Retinue of thoſe Deſires riſe not, ſo much, from the Neceſſities of remove from this Life, and ſenſible Supports, but immediately from the ſight of Eternal things themſelves: yet will not this conclude the Repentance ſincere. For we may eaſily pitch upon ſeveral ſo plain reaſons of theſe quick Apprehenſions of another World, that it is much more ſtrange, if any Man be not ſtruck with them; and they that are, are not in greater Extaſies of theſe Conſiderations, than that moſt die in ſome fair inclinable Temper towards them, and others are extraordinarily ſurprized with them, yet without true Repentance.</p>
                  <p>For Firſt, If it were no more, but the leiſure, and unintereſtedneſs of the Mind in all worldly things, that Death brings: It is no wonder that the Action of it ſhould immediately, and neceſſarily flow upon God; for it being always in action, and motion from its very Nature, and God having made it for himſelf;
<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99379:123"/> and the manner of its living here in the World being a ſlavery willingly undertaken for the Service of the Body, and the Enjoyment of this preſent Life, in its being fallen from God: It is nothing ſtrange, that that Drudgery being now at an end, and the chains wherein it was held, juſt a breaking, it ſhould fall upon God, and Spiritual Objects, whither the ſtream of it was prepared to run, and which are moſt truly its own buſineſs. For the diſtance being ſo wide, and irreconcilable between Man, and this Earth in Death; the very having nothing elſe to do muſt car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry him upon the Future State; ſeeing his Soul is ſuch a Being as cannot naturally lie ſtill, and that State is all, that it hath to work upon, and further than that, it is ſo nearly allied to it.</p>
                  <p>Secondly, The very looſening and uncementing the Soul from the Body, wherein it dwelt, and wherein the Motions of it were re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained,<note place="margin">Multi enim quum remiſſi &amp; liberi ſunt futura proſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciunt, ex quo intelligitur quales futuri ſint quum ſe plane corporis vinculis relax<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>averint. <hi>Cic.</hi> de Senectut.</note> hath been thought very probably to give Men leſſer de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees of thoſe Advantages near their Death, which naked and free Spirits not incloſed and pent up in Bodies have, whereby they have been able to make Conjectures of future things, and to ſpeak pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>phetically. The leſs the Soul is bound to work by the Body, the higher are its Operations. All ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>traordinary Motions of the Soul are a kind of Raviſhment from Senſe. Thoſe great Prophetick Bleſſings of <hi>Jacob and Moſes</hi> were near their Dying.<note place="margin">Gen. 49. Deut. 32. c. 33.</note> It is therefore very eaſie
<pb n="36" facs="tcp:99379:124"/> to be thought, that when the Soul and Body are ready to cleave aſunder, and the Spirit to be ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Fleſh, that it ſhould make an higher flight towards Eternal Things.</p>
                  <p>The nearer every thing is to its own Reſidence, the more vehement is its motion ſaid to be thither. So there may very well be quick ſallies of the Soul to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards Eternity, before it enters into it, when it is ſo near that everlaſting Receptacle of it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Thirdly, We may obſerve in the Experience of all times, every appearance of the other World hath ſtrange effects of Fear, and affrightment upon Mens Minds: When any one is entring then into that whole World, it may well put him upon purifying himſelf, more than they that fall upon <hi>Leviathan,</hi> Job 41.25. When Men are juſt upon that Region of Spirits, what appalements of Mind and ſtrong work<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of Thoughts muſt there needs be? Much more if the Soul have any ſenſe of its approach to the in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finite Holineſs of God, at whoſe rebuke the Pillars of Heaven tremble; whoſe preſence aſtoniſhes the purer Spirits of Angels, and beats down the Souls of good Men to the Duſt, as of <hi>Moſes,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Heb. 12.21. Iſai. 6.5. Job 42.6. Dan. 10.8.</note> 
                     <hi>Job, Iſaiah, &amp;c.</hi> in his interviews with them. How much more of thoſe that have never thought of God, and now muſt come near his Seat?</p>
                  <p>Nothing ſo compoſes the Soul to this amazing change of Condition and Converſe, as long continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed Treaties with God through Chriſt: when though Men change their place, they do not change their company:<note place="margin">Job 24.17. Job 38.15.</note> Others, when this great <hi>light ſtrikes
<pb n="37" facs="tcp:99379:124"/> them, are in the very terrors of the ſhadow of death, and ſhaken out of their place,</hi> out of all the Security, and quiet Senſuality they lived in.</p>
                  <p>Let us now take the eſtimate or avail of theſe things to true Repentance, and we ſhall find, when the Soul lies thus uncovered to the things of Eternity, it hath natural Reaſons for all, it may ſeem to do like return to God, and ſo that all argue nothing of the true Grace of God; but if a Man were again in his former State he would be the very ſame he was: For firſt, as one thing ſtrikes upon another with a na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tural Effect, Light upon the Eye, Sound upon the Ear, ſo Eternal Things upon the Immortal Spirit, when there is nothing between to intercept the ſtroke. Further,<note place="margin">1 John 2.16.</note> when <hi>the luſt of the fleſh, the luſt of the eye, and the pride of life</hi> are as a Scene remo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, and a Play at an end; and inſtead of them another World drawing near, juſt as Men defeated in all their attempts for Riches, and Honours, and beaten off from them to a private Life, call all theſe things Cheats; not out of true Reaſon, but becauſe they cannot reach them: on the other ſide they praiſe Retirement and a Cloyſter, not that they like it, but becauſe they muſt live ſo, which begets ſome kind of Contentedneſs ſo to live. Thus and no otherwiſe do many Dying Men call all this World Vanity, and profeſs an high Eſteem for all things pertaining to that to come.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cauſe</hi> 3. There is yet a more preſſing Account of the moſt notable motions that were ever found in any of their Repentances, <hi>viz.</hi> The awakenings of Conſcience uſual at this time, becauſe of the Senſe of a Judgment: while common Experience tells
<pb n="38" facs="tcp:99379:125"/> Men, <hi>It is appointed, to all Men once to die,</hi> Heb. 9.27. and ſinking Nature gives notice, This is the time: Conſcience lifts up to the next thing. <hi>After that the Judgment.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>Now no Man ſees Judgment, a Judgment Omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſcient, Omnipreſent, Eternal, without great ſhakes of Soul, eſpecially that hath done nothing ſeriouſly <hi>to agree with the adverſary in the way,</hi> Luk. 12.18. Conſcience then riſing up with the Awe of a Tribu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal upon it, ſtirs up all the Powers to fly from the Wrath that is to come, by deſires of Pardon, and Reſolutions of Amendment. The very hearing of Judgment made ſuch a one as <hi>Foe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lix tremble.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25.</note> When Judgment ſeems to us, at the other end of Heaven, all is quiet; but when Death brings us to the very ſeat of it, how loud may be the cries for Mercy? The bewailing the former evils of Life? Now Men pour out their Complaints for the want of God, the miſimprovement of former time: Now they make large offers of a ſtrict and ſevere Mortifi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, and Devotion to Religion. Now they would give <hi>the thouſand Rams, the ten thouſand Rivers of Oyl, their firſt born for their Traſgreſſion, the fruit of their Body for the ſin of their Soul,</hi> Mic. 6.6, 7. And yet all but the Eye opened to ſee the flaming Sword of Juſtice, that makes even a <hi>Balaam</hi> wiſh to die the death of the Righteous,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 22.32. <hi>cap.</hi> 23.10.</note> and to have a latter End, Sober, Juſt, Religious.</p>
                  <p>The very Suſpition of a Judgment inclines Men thus far univerſally almoſt, that hardly any chooſe to die in a Rant, in a Madneſs; but had rather by
<pb n="39" facs="tcp:99379:125"/> virtue, and Religion be conſigned over to another World; and have their Eyes cloſed by Mercy, and Grace in Chriſt: They would ſee the Salvation of God, and ſo depart in Peace.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 1. But it may be objected: Seeing theſe granted to riſe from true Conviction, and not to be Diſſimulation, or counterfeit Pretence, Why may not they have the worth of true Repentance?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 1. To anſwer this: Let me conſider, pure Conviction, and enlightned Apprehenſion, and the Affections begotten of them, are no Argument of true Goodneſs, where the Light hath not a benign, and free Operation upon the Judgment, an Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon the Will, an Indearment upon the Affections, to turn them to a full Delight, and Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction in God and Holineſs, and to a diſlike and abhorrence of Sin. For elſe, the Devils, <hi>who believe and tremble,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Jam.</hi> 2.19.</note> muſt be thought Converts. For who have clearer ſight of things than they? <hi>Balaam,</hi> whoſe Eyes were opened, and ſpoke ſo great things of God, and his People, muſt be concluded a good Man. <hi>Eſau</hi> and <hi>Judas,</hi> who had ſo ſad apprehenſions of Sin,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Matth.</hi> 27.4. <hi>Heb.</hi> 12.7. <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.17. <hi>and</hi> 6.26. <hi>Luk.</hi> 6.20. <hi>Acts</hi> 24.25.</note> and their loſs by it, muſt be affirmed to be Penitents. <hi>Nebucadnezar</hi>'s and <hi>Darius</hi> his acknowledgments of God muſt be taken for true Grace. <hi>Herod</hi> his hearing <hi>John Baptiſt</hi> gladly. <hi>Felix</hi> his trem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bling at <hi>Paul</hi>'s Diſcourſe, may be thought Eviden<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces of true Repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Object.</hi> 2. But Secondly it may be ſuppoſed, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe theſe very Convictions and Affections are not
<pb n="40" facs="tcp:99379:126"/> univerſal; but we ſee multitudes go out of the World without them, carrying little better than a decent and civil Reſpect to Religion, that therefore there is ſomething of God, ſomething Heroick in them, that have them.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> 2. This indeed may be no other, than the wiſe and good Government of God over the World; whereby he takes care, there ſhould be Teſtimonies of himſelf, and the Goodneſs of his ways; that Athe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>iſm, and Wickedneſs may not carry it, as if all were their own, as if there were an unexceptionable Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>currence on their ſide againſt God and Holineſs. For as he receives witneſs from the conſtant, gracious and religious Lives of good Men, ſo he conſtrains ſome of them, that have lived contrary to him all their lives, to give him glory at laſt, for the good of others, though without ſaving benefit to themſelves. Which he may juſtly do, and without any injury to them. Seeing all the Service every Creature can do to him, is infinitely due, he may make uſe of that which is his own, ſo far as he pleaſes. And becauſe <hi>what the word God puts in their mouths,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 23.5. <hi>Matth.</hi> 12.35.</note> is not their own, not ariſing out of the <hi>good treaſure of their hearts</hi> (as appears in <hi>Balaam</hi>) therefore their everlaſting Condition is not determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned by it, but by their conſtant Courſe of the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Life, the true Image of their Hearts, as we ſee in the ſame <hi>Balaam,</hi> who after died by the <hi>Iſraelites</hi> hand,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Num.</hi> 31.8.</note> whoſe greatneſs he had propheſied. Yet I will not deny, but they may have their reward in miti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gation of Puniſhment for any Service done to God.</p>
                  <p>If God did not interpoſe thus ſometimes, he might
<pb n="41" facs="tcp:99379:126"/> ſeem wanting in ſomething that concerned him, at leaſt as a gracious Ruler of the World. He therefore over-rules ſome, who have lived ſo, as to make a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtant Argument againſt him, and a future State (ſo far as Wickedneſs could do it) to retract the whole Courſe of their Life, and give their Vote, for what they had ſo long withſtood.</p>
                  <p>I will yet further add another Cauſe of a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance,</hi> that ſometimes falls out to have a moſt powerful Influence, and yet the Repentance that ſprings from it, is very unſafe to confide in.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Cauſe</hi> 4. Dying Men are oft under the play and force of other Mens Reaſon and Religion. For it is a general, and neceſſary Charity of Men affected to Religion themſelves, to offer the ſenſe of it to others, in a time when they think it likely to be accept<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed, and ſo infinitely neceſſary; which Practice how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever needful, and moſt commendable in it ſelf, yet by accident may have raiſed higher the opinion of a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance,</hi> and is often the occaſion of great Error in the thing it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>For ſuppoſe a Man followed with ſound and affe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctionate Perſwaſions, to do all that may be done for his Soul in this exigent; how conceiveable is it, that Man may be ſo far wrought upon, as to enter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain a preſent ſenſe of Religion, and yet have no true Life, no Life that ariſes from a true intimate Principle. But as thoſe Bodies of Air taken, and moved by Angels ſeem to perform the Functions of living Bodies, yet do but ſeem to do ſo, for they have no Principle of Life natural to them; but as ſoon, as they are forſaken by the Spirits that made uſe of them, they fly abroad, and diſperſe themſelves. Thus that general ſenſe of Conſcience, that lies ſcat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered
<pb n="42" facs="tcp:99379:127"/> through the Soul, and unable for action, being gathered together and united by good and holy Ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plications, and acted thereby, may have force ſo long, as that Union continues; but that Diſcourſe that holds it together ceaſing, it immediately falls aſunder, and loſes its Efficacy.</p>
                  <p>The Stone that receives motion from the Hand, that throws it, goes on whilſt that motion laſts, when that is ſpent, it falls to the ground: ſo the force of Exhortation ceaſes too often, when he that gives it, leaves thoſe to whom it was given.</p>
                  <p>The Inſtrument to which the Muſician's Hand gives tune and voice, lies dead when he deſerts it: Mans Soul is made by God capable of religious tune and motion, and while a skillful hand plays upon it, it may give that ſound very diſtinctly, and yet have no Life in it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>The ſtriking of Conſcience makes the Sparks fly out, yea and ſometime kindle in a flame, and yet it preſently dies, becauſe not ſupplied with a continual Oyl to feed it.</p>
                  <p>The Mind of one Man is very apt to receive Im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſions from another; we ſee what Paſſions and Motions are raiſed by an Eloquent Speaker; how the Underſtanding is carried captive, while the Orator works upon it: and yet all the Affection thus blown up falls flat again, when the Breath that ſwell'd it lies ſtill, and is apt to be carried the contrary way by croſs Perſwaſions equally inſinuated.</p>
                  <p>How much more may this be in religious things? Conſcience being ſo eaſily ſtirred by ſuch Applicati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, as we ſee in <hi>Felix,</hi> though it is as eaſily be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>calmed, when ſinful Luſts, through the Efficacy of Temptation, are loud and high.</p>
                  <pb n="43" facs="tcp:99379:127"/>
                  <p>And all this is certainly much eaſilier done near Death, when Men are ſo ſoft, that they are apt to take any ſtamp; ſo melting, as to be gathered into any mould.</p>
                  <p>It is poſſible for one Man's Spirit to carry another for ſome conſiderable ſpace of time, as we ſee in <hi>Jehoiadas</hi> influence upon <hi>Joaſh,</hi> who was not yet all that time poſſeſſed with the things themſelves,<note place="margin">2 <hi>King.</hi> 12.1.</note> whereunto he was directed.</p>
                  <p>But true Repentance is a Frame ſet up by the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit of God in the Heart, ſubſiſting by that Spirit up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on it ſelf, and makes uſe only of all Helps ſubordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nated to it, by the Wiſdom of that Spirit; but doth not live from that Help, but from it ſelf through that Spirit, its ſupreme Life.</p>
                  <p>To draw theſe things therefore to a Sum, It will appear, after all theſe Cauſes have done, what they can, theſe great Errors following are generally found, and always to be ſuſpected in a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. In a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance,</hi> There is only a Judgment made of the Caſe of Eternity, conſidered by it ſelf, and without a Conterpoiſe: The Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lency of God and Eternal Things are minded, as they ſtand out of the Air of Temptation. Now though this be a good Opportunity for the firſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſideration, yet that Conſideration muſt grow ſo ſtrong, as to retain the ſame ſenſe, in the midſt of all Pretences from the World and Sathan. Elſe in the time of Temptation this Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance falls away.<note n="*" place="margin">

                     <q rend="inline">For there may be many true Appre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>henſions, which may make deep
<pb n="44" facs="tcp:99379:128"/> Impreſſion not only in the Brain and Phancy, and upon our Affections, whileſt theſe are calm, and unprovok'd, and yet both the Apprehenſion and Impreſſion quickly vaniſh upon the ſtarting, or provocation of contrary Fancies or Affections.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p>When the Blood cools in the Veins, and the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rits are ready to ſtand ſtill, when a Man is no lon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger to live in the World, <hi>the ſeaſon of the pleaſures of Sin is over,</hi> then to caſt out his Luſts, <hi>What excellent thing does he? does not even nature,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Matth. 5.46.</note> 
                     <hi>whether he will or no, the ſame?</hi> True Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance encounters Temptation, and reſiſts unto Blood, when thoſe Pleaſures of Sin are at the height, and the tide of Corruption from within ſwells moſt. <hi>As</hi> Moſes <hi>choſe to ſuffer affliction with the people of God rather than to enjoy the pleaſures of ſin for a ſeaſon,</hi> Heb. 11.25. although they were in their growing, and aſcending Morning. Repentance will not worſhip that Sun in the Eaſt. It is a very ſmall thing to deſpiſe it in the Weſt, and juſt a ſetting; to chooſe Religion, when there is nothing to vie with it.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. It is not a Conſideration of heavenly Things in their true worth, but only as recommended by the preſent Neceſſity. For who would not die the Death of the Righteous, and have his latter end like his? Every Man at that time would be glad to find, he hath lived well; and he that hath lived worſt, except he be outrageous in Prophaneneſs, will wiſh he had lived better. Eternity at hand gives value to all Holineſs and ſenſe of God, in ſpight of the World; and leſſens all things elſe to <hi>a nothing, and leſs than nothing;</hi> imprints a Ghaſtlineſs and Horror upon all Wickedneſs and
<pb n="45" facs="tcp:99379:128"/> Senſuality. <hi>The thirty pieces are nothing worth,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 27.3.</note> and the <hi>innocent blood above all value,</hi> when Men ſuffer in the Agonies of Conſcience, and Fears of the approaching Judge. <hi>A Houſe full of Silver and Gold</hi> will not buy a Man to reſiſt God, when in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed he appears to him; <hi>when the terrible Majeſty</hi> opens it ſelf,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Numb.</hi> 22.18.</note> what is ſo precious, that Men <hi>will not fling to the Bats and Moles?</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Iſai.</hi> 2.20.</note> When the Breath is go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing out of the Noſtrils, how precious is Repentance, Faith, a Pardon in Chriſt, a happy Eternity, to thoſe, who have heretofore ſlighted them, as the off-ſcouring of all things?</p>
                  <p>But theſe things are always ſo rich, Wiſdom is always ſo precious, that it diſdains to borrow Eſteem from a minute of Extremity; and therefore it moſt often falls out, that thoſe who would none of its counſel, but deſpiſed all its Reproof, when they come to ſeek it early, cannot find it, but it laughs at their Calamity, as Men laugh at the unhappineſs of Fools, that would not be corrected in their Folly, till their Miſery confute their Confidence.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. From hence it follows, That this Repentance is a Choice, when there is no other Choice: If a Man loved his Sins, or the World never ſo paſſion<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately, he muſt leave them; if he diſliked God, and his Holineſs, and an everlaſting Abode with him, to the utmoſt; yet he is even forced upon them, or daſhed upon an Eternal Miſery, and Unhappineſs, which it is impoſſible to chooſe: And therefore though he would not chooſe the holy ways of God, if he might ſtill enjoy former Vanity, yet that being
<pb n="46" facs="tcp:99379:129"/> out of his reach and way, he muſt take what is to be had. The Senſe therefore is no more than this, All theſe things are good, when a Man is juſt a Dy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing; but while he lives, and can have the World, they are troubleſom and unprofitable: Death makes them good, upon this account only, becauſe elſe there would be ſomething worſe, and there can no longer be any thing better. A Man is now willing to offer a Life he hath not to give, but Eternal Life is not worth any part of that Life he thinks in his power to do any thing elſe with. Let us then ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve at what rate it is ſet; for to uſe <hi>Tertullian</hi>'s words in another Caſe, we may thus Reaſon.<note n="*" place="margin">Quale bonum hoc eſt, quod melius eſt, poe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>na, quod non poteſt videri bonum, niſi peſſimo compa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ratum; ut ideo bonum ſit reſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piſcere, quia deterius est ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dere.

Chap. <hi>3.</hi>
                     </note> 
                     <q rend="inline">What a mean ſort of good is this, that only excels Puniſhment, which needs the worſt of States for a Foil to it ſelf, that it may be thought Good? It is good to repent, and be ſaved, becauſe who can dwell with everlaſting Burnings? But if it muſt purchaſe the Reputa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of being Good from Evil, it is not ſo much a Good, as a lower degree of Evil; which while the greater Evil Eclipſes it is compelled as it were to accept the name of a good, being dri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven upon the confines of Good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs by the Violence of greater Evil.</q>
                  </p>
                  <p n="4">4. This Repentance is not the Free, but inſlaved Judgment and Choice of the Soul; as Men caſt out
<pb n="47" facs="tcp:99379:129"/> Goods in a Storm, and receive a Power to Rule over them, that they cannot endure, but that it is too ſtrong for them. Men are afraid what God will do to them, therefore they ſubmit. His Enemies in Heart are found Lyers to him, they flatter him with their Mouth, as <hi>Julian</hi> oppreſſed by the Almighti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of Chriſt, is ſtoried to have cried out, <hi>Viciſti Galilaee,</hi> Thou haſt overcome me, <hi>Galilean.</hi> Thus they are overcome by Death, and the apprehenſion of Judgment. In the ſight and view of the Danger Men reſolve to part with their Sins. Let but that re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>move, they call for their Sins again, as Mariners wiſh for their Goods after the Storm. They throw up their Luſts in their ſickneſs, but drink them in when their trouble is paſt, <hi>as the Dog returns to his vomit,</hi> 2 Pet. 2.22. In all this there is nothing of the love of God.</p>
                  <p n="5">5. In this Repentance, the Soul of it is generally a pitiful mean Self-love, even the meaneſt kind imaginable, wherein a Man conſiders himſelf as a Creature in being, and likely, or at leaſt poſſible to be for ever; without any apprehenſion of himſelf, as a rational Creature made for God, and the Enjoy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of him, in conforming with whom his Happi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs conſiſts, and in the reſting for ever in his love. Of this part he hath no diſtinct apprehenſion, only he would be happy though he knows not what it is, or rather he would not be miſerable; yet even that he truly underſtands not. But as the Jews ſaid to Chriſt, when he ſpake to them of the Bread of Life, <hi>Lord ever more give us this bread;</hi> and yet were ſcandalized at his Explanation of himſelf to be that Bread, ſo far as to leave him.<note place="margin">
                        <hi>John</hi> 6.34.</note> And the Phariſees hearing <hi>of the Vineyard to be let out to other Hus<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>band-men,</hi>
                     <pb n="48" facs="tcp:99379:130"/> and the Judgment up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on themſelves to be executed,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Luk.</hi> 20.16.</note> Cried out, <hi>God forbid,</hi> yet run on in the Sin, that brought it upon them.</p>
                  <p>This little point of Self-love into which all is crowded is ennobled with no ſight of the Excellency of the things themſelves, or a due Eſtimation of them, as the true pleaſure, and joy of an Immortal Spirit.</p>
                  <p>This is not that allowable love of a Man's ſelf, which incircles it ſelf within the love of God, as the leſſer Circle is comprehended by the greater, but this either leaves out that love wholly, or debaſes it to baſeſt ſelf.</p>
                  <p>Let us now compare both ſides together, and ſee how much true Repentance differs from that, which is always to be feared, leſt it ſhould be the height of the Death-Bed: And of that which hath been ſpoken, this is the Sum,</p>
                  <p>True Repentance is the moſt free Election of the Soul inabled by the Grace of God, upon a clear, and juſt Dictate of the Judgment, attended with ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cereſt Affection, to give up it ſelf to God through Jeſus Chriſt, and when it is moſt it ſelf, not under any irregular fear or conſtraint, and (at leaſt would be the ſame) in a time, when it hath all the probabi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity that can be to lay hold upon things preſent.</p>
                  <p>The other Repentance ariſes from a Soul all trou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bled, and diſcompoſed with the throws of Death, the fears of Hell, the Doubts what will become of it in another World, the Uproars of a guilty Conſci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ence; when it ſuppoſes it ſelf neceſſarily at the full ſtop of its former Courſes, by being cut off from longer Life, in the midſt of all which ariſe vehement Reſolutions to turn from Sin to God, and poſſibly
<pb n="49" facs="tcp:99379:130"/> with many fair Apparences, but without opportuni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty to give proof of themſelves.</p>
                  <p>Let any one Judge between theſe two Repentan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ces, and accordingly even counſel himſelf concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing them.</p>
                  <p>Yet I muſt acknowledge this Diſcourſe ſubject to theſe following Limitations.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That the Arguments I have inſiſted upon pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vail not only againſt a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance,</hi> but againſt all Repentances, that have no higher Spirit to move them, than what I have now repreſented; from hence therefore we may take the trial of our Repentance in general, for though a Death-Bed is moſt ſubject to theſe miſtakes, yet whatever Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance falls under them, is by reaſon of them in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>valid; and the later any Repentance is, or the more it is occaſioned by any Extremity, which it doth not out-live, the more ſubject it is to them.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. What I have ſaid is not at all to be underſtood of the perfecting and conſummating Repentance, by higher and fuller Acts towards God at Death, though enforced by the preſent Circumſtances of the Caſe. For true Repentance running through the whole life, takes advantage of every thing, much more of ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderable an Opportunity to unite all our ſtrength for God, as a Death-bed brings with it. All that hath been ſpoken is deſigned againſt truſting to the <hi>Extreme <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nction</hi> of a dying Repentance, juſt then begun.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. I have before reſolved upon that tendereſt Do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctrin, that it is poſſible among all the unhappy Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances of a Dying-Bed, there yet may be this true Act of the Underſtanding, Will, and Affections turning to God; and if there be this, it would be the ſame and alike, however theſe Circumſtances
<pb n="50" facs="tcp:99379:131"/> alter, and then it excels thoſe temporary Amend<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments undertaken in the freeſt times of Life. But becauſe it is but poſſible and ſo almoſt impoſſible, ſo unhappy a Caſe, (as not to have repented till juſt we die) ſhould fall out ſo happily, the Intention of this Diſcourſe ſtands good notwithſtanding.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. I acknowledge, the choice of the Soul can never be ſo free, but it muſt be ſubject to infinitely the moſt worthy and preponderating conſiderations of the love and goodneſs of God, the Redemption of Chriſt, the greatneſs of eternal Happineſs moſt indear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing on one ſide; of the fear and terror of the Lord, the loſs of a Soul, everlaſting perdition, moſt per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwaſive on the other ſide; ſo that if a Man cannot be free in his choice of Religion, except he chooſe it without the force of any ſuch conſideration, he can never be at all free, for theſe are on all ſides of him: And further, there is always the ſupream motion of the Grace of God, which does not leſſen, but ſteer and exalt the freedom of the Will towards God.</p>
                  <p>The difference then between true and falſe Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in this particular is the ſame, that is, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween juſt and rational conſideration of all the mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tives of Hope and Fear; and the hurry of them moving us not intellectually, but as a Tempeſt, or with the force of a meer Engine. 2. Between the higheſt reaſons carrying the chiefeſt force, and leading along with them the lower ones, and the lower doing all without the higher, for want of which they are Senſual or Helliſh. 3. Between the government of meer Providence, and of the Spirit of God. 4. Between the Repentance of <hi>Cain, Eſau, Saul, Judas,</hi> and the Repentance of <hi>David, Manaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeh, Peter,</hi> and <hi>Paul.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <pb n="51" facs="tcp:99379:131"/>
                  <p n="5">5. I acknowledge the firſt Preparations of the Soul by God for himſelf, may be with a great deal of noiſe and confuſion; <hi>Clouds and Darkneſs are the Duſt of his Feet, Storms go before him to prepare his way;</hi> while theſe laſt, there cannot be a ſerene calm Act of the Soul, and he that doth not live till he <hi>hear that ſtill Voice,</hi> in which God is, is in great danger of being loſt in the Storm. But if out of this Darkneſs and Confuſion, a holy and gracious Settlement pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceed, it is not the worſe for being ſo introduced, but is agreeable with the uſual method of God.</p>
                  <p>The fourth Head I propoſed, is to weigh the Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance <hi>of the Crucified Malefactor</hi> againſt our common <hi>Death-Bed Repentances;</hi> which duly per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formed will be of great force againſt Preſumption, rather than miniſter it any Confidence.</p>
                  <p>For we ſhall find ſo much gathered together, and preſſed down into it, that as Jewels have their Rich<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>es in a little room, ſo his ſhort Life of Penitency had an Age of Repentance in it.</p>
                  <p>It is ſo compoſed of Extraordinaries, that it can give very little encouragement in ordinary Caſes, except juſt thus much; that Repentance at Death is no abſolute impoſſibility.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Let us obſerve how his Repentance look'd to the ſeveral parts of Repentance; for though it had but little time in this World to breath in, yet with extraordinary diligence, it was buſie in all the great, and moſt concerning Points. Yet I account this of the leaſt Remark in the Hiſtory of his Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, becauſe it is eaſily imitable, That in which it Excelled, was the Evidences of Sincerity it car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ried.</p>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:99379:132"/>
                  <p n="1">1. Yet take notice of his Senſe and Acknowledg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment of Sin, which was not only a Confeſſion of Words, but of his very Soul; for, deliberating things in a Moment, he pronounced him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf ſelf worthy of the Condemnation and Puniſhment he endured.<note place="margin">Magnum eſt poenitentiae ſig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num in poena ſua acquieſcere. <hi>Grot.</hi> in locum.</note> I confeſs this is not ſo infrequent in thoſe, who forfeited their Lives to Juſtice, but how oft is it rather a Formality, than the inward ſenſe of the Mind condecently affected? and poſſibly if we look upon the out-ſide of things, we can find no great difference between him and others. Yet it is a neceſſary part of Repentance, <hi>The ſacrifice of God is a broken and contrite heart,</hi> Pſal. 51.17.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. In his Repentance lay a lively Faith in Chriſt; firſt reſting upon the principle, And truth of the thing; That <hi>Chriſt was a juſt Perſon,</hi> that he <hi>had a Kingdom;</hi> and then a particular Application to him for Mercy, <hi>Lord remember me when thou comeſt in thy Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="3">3. A quick ſenſe of Eternity ſupplied Vigor to his Repentance, an evident ſight of ſomething be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>yond this world. For what more excites the Soul, and ſhews it the neceſſity of a gracious Change, than an everlaſting Condition appearing to it? To this end hath <hi>Jeſus Chriſt brought life and immortality to light,</hi> 2 Tim. 1.10. of which this Penitent made a very full Confeſſion; <hi>Lord remember me when thou comeſt in thy Kingdom.</hi> He ſaw a Kingdom beyond the Croſs and Death.</p>
                  <p n="4">4. An earneſt deſire to promote and propagate a ſenſe of God into the Hearts of others was the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mediate fruit of this Malefactors Repentance. He
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:99379:132"/> admoniſhes the Impenitent Thief on the other ſide, <hi>Doſt thou not fear God?</hi> He had ſuch a Reverence of God, that he expoſtulates the want of it in the other as monſtrous and horrid. His deſign was alſo exceeding Compaſſionate, as well as Pious: For it was an Endeavour full of Charity, deſirous his guilty Fellow-ſufferer ſhould be brought into the ſame Condition with himſelf. We want much of the Compaſſion due to the Souls of others, becauſe we are ſo inſenſible of the miſery of our own; and taſte but little of the ſweetneſs of Reconciliation and Grace: But when we drink largely out of theſe Fountains, we derive the Streams upon others, that have flowed upon our ſelves.</p>
                  <p>All theſe things were evidently much to the pur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſe, if we look upon themſelves: Yet were there nothing more extraordinary in them, we might doubt whether they were any more than the good Mood, into which Principles of Conſcience excited by the unhappineſs his Condition might put him: Let us then conſider the Evidence, that all this was truly Supernatural; for I account it no Injury to ſo memorable a Repentance to ſuppoſe, that as great and fair an out-ſide may have fail'd of Paradiſe, into which he entred. But,</p>
                  <p n="2">2. The acknowledgment he made of Chriſt gives teſtimony to him in two things.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That it was made, when Chriſt was under all the Infamy, and Miſery of a ſhameful and painful Death, and nothing to make ſuch a Greatneſs, as he aſcribed to him probable. Among us that in gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Language ſpeak honourably of Chriſt, Profeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of him are cheap, and prove nothing. But if one bred in Turciſm, or Judaiſm, ſhould confeſs him,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:99379:133"/> it would argue much more; yet not ſo much as in this Malefactor, who ſaw him in ſo deſpicable a State: Whereas now ſo great a part of the World acknowledging him,<note place="margin">
                        <hi>Acts</hi> 1.9.</note> hath carried him up to Heaven, as it were <hi>in that Cloud, wherein he aſcended long ago,</hi> and hid <hi>the reproach of his Croſs</hi> in ſo high a Glory, eſpecially among us.</p>
                  <p>To confeſs him in his worſt eſtate, and before any thing of the Conſequence was known, was very great:<note n="*" place="margin">Extrema fi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>des, ſed non minima. <hi>Aug.</hi> Serm. <hi>122.</hi> de Temp.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt was revealed to him,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Mat.</hi> 16.17.</note> 
                     <hi>not by Fleſh and Blood;</hi> but by God himſelf. Such an Heroick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs is indeed neceſſary to aſſure a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance,</hi> which had need be as great, as it is late, when Men do not live to ſee the ordinary fruits of it.</p>
                  <p>He that could ſee Chriſt, and his Glory, through ſo dark a Vail, had <hi>his Eyes anointed with that Eye-Salve,</hi> Chriſt ſpeaks of.<note n="†" place="margin">Ad rem cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dendam a ſenſibus remotiſſimam excitatus eſt. <hi>Grot.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>We find the Apoſtles, who had ſeen his Miracles, heard his Divine Diſcourſes, made long Acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledgments of him, were fearfully ſhaken by this Aſſault <hi>of the power of Darkneſs upon him;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">
                        <hi>Rev.</hi> 3.18.</note> even to a Deſpair, that he was the Chriſt. But while they were in a ſwoon of Faith,<note place="margin">Quando paſſus eſt, omnes diſcipuli deſperaverunt quod ipſe eſſet Chriſtus. A latrone victi ſunt Apoſtoli. qui tunc cre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>didit, quando illi defecerunt. <hi>Aug.</hi> in <hi>Pſal. 68.</hi>
                     </note>
                     <pb n="55" facs="tcp:99379:133"/> this Faith with Chriſt triumphed over Principalities and Powers, even on the Croſs.</p>
                  <p>We looking upon the things of Chriſtianity in the common Profeſſion of the Nation, It is a hard thing for us to ſee them otherwiſe, than that caſts them; as it would be for thoſe that have known nothing but the Religion of <hi>Mahomet,</hi> Paganiſm, or the Jewiſh Synagogue, to take up upon the ſudden the Doctrin of Chriſtianity againſt their own.</p>
                  <p>We believing not with our own Faith, but Vul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gar Opinion, eaſily make a Confeſſion of Chriſt; yet oftentimes the Power and ſaving Effect of it is far from us, as from thoſe that are Strangers to him: ſometimes they that come from the Eaſt, and from the Weſt, ſit down in the Kingdom of God, when the Children of the Kingdom are thruſt out.</p>
                  <p>The Acknowledgment of Chriſt in thoſe Times, was a much fairer Evidence, than it can be now; yet without inward Grace was nothing then; much leſs muſt it needs be to us, who have it made ready to our hands by Education and common Conſent in it; we muſt therefore the more narrowly obſerve, what Characters the Truth of Chriſt imprints upon our Hearts.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Acknowledgment was made without any manner of In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ducement, or Temptation to it,<note place="margin">Tanto namque pondere appen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſum eſt, tantum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>que valuit apud eum, qui novit haec appendere, quod confeſſus eſt Dominum Crucifixum, quantum ſi fuiſſet pro Domino Cruci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixus. <hi>Aug.</hi> De Anima &amp; ejus Origine.</note> from outward advantages, it could poſſibly afford; but rather an in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>creaſe of Shame and Scorn was to be expected from it; and that if it were poſſible, he ſhould ſuffer
<pb n="56" facs="tcp:99379:134"/> the ſecond time for ſuch a Confeſſion, and become of a Malefactor a Martyr. Nay further, there was no Dictate of Natural Conſcience, that could in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cline him to it; for that runs not into the Confeſſion of Chriſt, nor is any way quieted concerning former Sins through ſuch a Confeſſion; but eyes God only, and Moral Righteouſneſs: Laſtly, no general Tra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition prompted him to it, the Jews at that time condemning him. But in us, all Applications to Chriſt are ſecuring our ſelves in the common Barque, and keep us from being cenſured, as prophane, and irreligious Perſons. For to die without any addreſs to Chriſt, is accounted very ungodly, and ſenſleſs of a Future State; but to deny him, monſtrous and deſperate. Further, Chriſtianity is incorporated with our natural Principles, ſo that they never move, or heave themſelves in us, but that alſo riſes with them.</p>
                  <p>Now it is of great Importance in the tryal of Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerity, upon what Grounds and Motives we do, what do; and the more we can clear it from inferiour Springs, the more certainly it is <hi>Grace deſcending from above, and reſting upon us,</hi> Jam. 1.17.</p>
                  <p>Every one therefore that would juſtifie a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance,</hi> muſt exceed all common ſorts of Repentance, elſe he cannot enter into the Kingdom of Heaven. N<gap reason="illegible" resp="#KEYERS" extent="1 letter">
                        <desc>•</desc>
                     </gap>y he muſt do ſomething, that in the little ſpace of time, he hath to do it in, muſt equal a Courſe of amendment of Life; muſt be as great in him, as this Repentance of the Thief.</p>
                  <p>And do but think, if our Faith were to cut thoſe waves, his was to paſs, to row againſt ſuch a Stream, <hi>to remove ſuch mountains,</hi> among how many thou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſands
<pb n="57" facs="tcp:99379:134"/> there would be found a Faith to do it; we ſhould immediately be ſtopp'd; or ſunk, and caſt away, and loſt. Yet ſuch are they we are to paſs through into Eternal Life, though of different Cir<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cumſtances from his.</p>
                  <p>But after all I will allow it poſſible, there might be a ſecret flaw in this whole Penitent's Deportment, we now inſiſt upon; and that it far'd with him as with ſome among us, who after a wicked and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauched Life fly to the Sanctuary of the Romiſh Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ligion (<hi>as</hi> Joab <hi>to the horns of the Altar,</hi> 1 King. 2.28.) To Reconciliation wherewith Hopeleſneſs of any good from that they have ſo long ſinned againſt, and natural Superſtition hurry them. So this Perſon hearing a great Fame of Chriſt, and ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerving his pretence high, might lay hold upon him in a deſperate Caſe, if peradventure any thing of good might follow on it: It being very incidental to the Nature of Man to caſt himſelf upon Religion, when all elſe fails, and upon one new to him, when he hath offended againſt the old one, beyond hope of Pardon; whence Men generally receive this Recom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, that Conſcience is put into amuſe, having nothing at preſent to ſay againſt it.</p>
                  <p>And had this been the top of his Caſe, that it had been thus, could it have been ſaving? Nay, that it might poſſibly have been thus, though indeed it had been otherwiſe, yet this very liableneſs to ſuch a miſtake had unſpeakably abated the rational Secu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rity, and ſafety of his Condition, ſo that there had remained good cauſe for Conſcience to have mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtruſted which way his Condition would have fallen to Eternity.</p>
                  <pb n="58" facs="tcp:99379:135"/>
                  <p n="3">3. The Third thing therefore, that gave him, and gives to all Ages undoubted Teſtimony of the Truth of his Converſion, is the immediate atteſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to that Truth and Sincerity of it, <hi>This day ſhalt thou be with me in Paradiſe.</hi> Now that Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance which enters into Heaven, that paſſes into Pa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>radiſe, not hinder'd by thoſe <hi>flaming Cherubs of Divine Truth;</hi> that which is <hi>within the Door, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore the Maſter of the Houſe is riſen up and hath ſhut it to,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 13.25.</note> that is true Repentance and proſperous, and ſucceſsful, how late ſoever. But to know that it is true, when it is ſo late, needs a Voice from Heaven, or ſomething proportional to it, to verifie it, as is after to be urged.</p>
                  <p>The laſt thing I take notice of in this Repentance, is the unparallellable Circumſtance of time wherein it was accepted.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. It was in the time of a pub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lick act of mercy to the World,<note place="margin">Joh. 3.16.</note> 
                     <hi>God was in love to Mankind giv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing his only begotten Son.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Eph. 5.25.</note> 
                     <hi>Chriſt was giving himſelf at this time.</hi> Therefore that there ſhould be an Inſtance and Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nument of this Mercy, ſeem'd condecent to ſo great and ſolemn a time.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. This Penitent ſtood cloſe to that Sacrifice, that was offering it ſelf up to God: He ſtood within the Savour, the Odor, the Incenſe of it: That Sacrifice, <hi>that purchaſes men from a vain converſation;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Pet. 18.</note> that draws down all the Bleſſings of Salvation; that therefore the force of it ſhould reach ſo near it ſelf, is not ſtrange: I know no nearneſs of place ſigni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fies
<pb n="59" facs="tcp:99379:135"/> at all. How many ſaw his Miracles, heard him Preach, look'd upon him Dying without benefit? yet was his Preſence alſo, as he pleaſed, full of Divine effects. That therefore there ſhould be an experiment of ſo great a Balſom, juſt as it was pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paring, was moſt ſuitable.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. It was in the time that <hi>Chriſt was triumph<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing over Principalities and Powers, and making a ſhew of them openly upon the very Croſs.</hi>
                     <note n="*" place="margin">Vicem verſam reddidit Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus Diabolo; quemadmodum Diabolus depra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vando hominem abſtulerat de Paradiſo, ſic Chriſtus latronem confi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tentem erueret de inferno: Ille de interdicto ligno praeſumentem decepit; Iste pendentem de poenali ligno redemit. <hi>Aug.</hi> Serm. <hi>122.</hi> De Temp.</note> That he ſhould bear off in the Field the prey taken out of the mouth of the proud Foe, was very agreeable to the expectation ſo great a Conqueror raiſes. <hi>Coloſ.</hi> 2.15.</p>
                  <p>But whoever conſiders the Thief on the other ſide not converted, or ſaved, will find Cauſe to obſerve; The Salvation of Chriſt doth not ſweep the World, but is rarelier vouchſafed than we think; That a man may die without going to Heaven; That the mercy of the Goſpel is moſt arbitrary and ſovereign, chuſing and leaving; That it de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends not on humane Expectation, or any Super<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtitious phancies, that have been raiſed about the Croſs of Chriſt; for ſo much appears by one only taken here, the other left, though upon the Croſs together with Chriſt, and near him in the great and mediatory Act; who that conſiders will not tremble to think of one left in his ſins, falling
<pb n="60" facs="tcp:99379:136"/> down into Hell from ſuch a Heaven as Chriſt in his great Act of Redemption.</p>
                  <p>And although it may be truly ſaid, it was the fault, and negligence, and obſtinacy of the Unconverted Malefactor, that he did not uſe aright the Grace of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered, or the Light vouchſafed him; yet it doth not alleviate the danger, for it ſtill remains very uncer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tain to whom God will give a Heart to uſe Oppor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunities aright, though they have them from God with an equal Liberality, as thoſe that do ſo improve them.</p>
                  <p>But indeed, the Supremacy of Grace is here very much acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledged by all, that a Ray of the Divinity of Chriſt with infinite kindneſs ſmote his Soul.<note n="*" place="margin">Nova &amp; in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolita quaedam divinae virtutis efficacia, in ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>emplum omni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bus ſeculis me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>morabile, &amp;c. <hi>Grot.</hi> In locum.</note> I infer nothing from that increaſe, the Evangeliſt <hi>Matth.</hi> c. 27.44. gives the Miracle, That he was Convert<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed after he had joined with the other Malefactor in reproaching Chriſt; Becauſe<note n="†" place="margin">
                        <hi>Hieron.</hi> In locum.</note> ſome Interpre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters queſtion it.</p>
                  <p>Upon the whole then of this Example, let Men that would be befriended by a <hi>Dying Repentance,</hi> ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>amine whether theſe things found in this Example, are like to meet upon them. I will not ſay, till there be a time,<note place="margin">Beneficium multis modis inſigne &amp; non temere trahen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>di in conſequen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tias exempli. <hi>Grot.</hi> In locum.</note> a fulneſs of time, wherein Chriſt ſhall again die for Sinners, ſuch a Repentance is not to be expected; but I may ſafely ſay, he that in the Obſervation of this Example truſts himſelf to a <hi>Dying Repentance</hi> ſhould ſtartle
<pb n="61" facs="tcp:99379:136"/> his Preſumption with this Interrogation, Will there ever be ſuch a Conjunction, as was here, again, while the World endures?</p>
                  <p>I come now to the laſt Head of down-right Argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ments againſt committing our Eternal State to a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="1">1. It is againſt all the Prudence and Providence of a Man, ſeeing no Man knows what kind of Death he ſhall die; whether it will afford him the poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of Repenting: How many die ſuddenly, and in ſo ſhort a Breath, that they have not time to deſire Mercy in general? How many of Apoplexies ſeizing upon the very Top of Senſe at firſt? Many by Phren<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſies have no rational Motions of themſelves; innu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>merable Accidents (and oft-times made dreadful by the Wickedneſs wherewith they have been accom<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>panied) have ſnatch'd away Men in a Moment. <hi>Such are taken away living and in his wrath before the Pots can feel the Thorns,</hi>

                  <p>Thus therefore to imagine of God is to bring down in our own Thoughts thoſe great Attributes of Juſtice and Wiſdom, into a fooliſh and unreaſon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able Pity, and only for this end, that there may be a Licentiouſneſs in Wickedneſs and Impiety.</p>

It is impoſſible to a Man to die with good com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſure of Mind, that truſts to a Dying Repentance; for let the Caſe be thus ſtated, That Repentance, which will not inable a Man to a holy Life, is not ſaving; ſuppoſe a Man then in a Dying Sickneſs, ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king great acknowledgment of Sin, full of Reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions of leaving Sin, and this Man recovering and peforming nothing, but ſliding back into the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer Wretchedneſs of Life; this Repentance how<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever ſerious, and earneſt it ſeemed, would not have ſaved him, if he had died; he had periſhed in his Sins, and his falſe Repentance together: For that his Repentance was truly inferior to his Sins, appears, in that as ſoon as ever that is over, which gave it a ſeeming Advantage, his Sins throw off that Repentance;<note place="margin">Rev. 2.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note> but true Repentance always <hi>overcomes;</hi> that Repentance therefore could not be true.</p>
                  <p>And if Repentance be falſe and counterfeit, there is no amendment of it in Eternity; when once the <hi>Maſter of the Houſe is riſen up, and hath ſhut to the Door,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 13.25.</note> there is no entrance: While the <hi>fooliſh

                  <p>Yea though a Man may ſeem to be well quieted, and comforted, and to have the Teſtimony of the Spirit of God, yet all this may be but a Deluſion, and <hi>Satan in an Angel of light;</hi> for though they that have truly this Teſtimony, may be ſuppoſed to know it is that true Spirit; yet they that have it not,<note place="margin">2 Cor. 11.14.</note> may have ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing, they ſo ſtrongely imagine to be it, that thereby they may be deceived. This Teſtimony therefore muſt be proportionable to the aſſurance, this Dying Man had from Chriſt; elſe even a Man that dies ſafe, muſt die in ſuch an un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>expreſſible Torment of Mind, that it had been much better he had enjoyed no ſuch ſeaſons of Sin, than only endure that. And who can preſume ſo upon God, as to promiſe himſelf ſuch a train of Miracles to carry him not only to Heaven, but without thoſe Agonies of Horror that are like Hell, after ſo long Impenitency?</p>
                  <p>Thus on all ſides it is moſt neceſſary for every one to Repent while he may behold the Truth of his Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance in the ordinary Fruits of a holy Life; and ſee himſelf in all the Circumſtances of Temptation, change of Condition, Varieties, which Life and the Courſe of it carry along with it: For that is often by length of time caſt up, and appears upon the Surface, that lay concealed at the bottom, till ſuch a Concurrence of things gives it the advantage to riſe.</p>

                  <p>I underſtand nothing that can be objected to this laſt Argument I have uſed to diſable the Confidence of ſuch a Repentance, except this.</p>
                  <p>It may be ſuppoſed, the Repentance that is full of paſſionate and affectionate Motions towards God, though amidſt the fears of Death, may be good, till it be blotted out by returns to Sin, and therefore if it be taken in the juſt time, while it is good; that is, if a Man dies before it be reverſed, it may ſerve the great purpoſe of Eternity.</p>
                  <p>This Suppoſition I muſt confeſs hath a ſeeming Countenance from that particular place, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 33.12. <hi>The righteouſneſs of the righteous ſhall not deliver him in the day of his tranſgreſſion; as for the wick<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>edneſs of the wicked, he ſhall not fall thereby in the day that he turneth from his wickedneſs.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But if the ſcope of Scripture-Diſcourſe in general, or the very ſenſe of Morality be taken in the Caſe, no Man may truſt ſo great a weight here; For Chriſt looks upon <hi>the ſtony ground</hi> with the ſame Eye, <hi>while it receives the word with joy,</hi>

                     <hi>The Houſe that is not foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded upon the Rock,</hi> is as ill founded in the Calm, as in the Storm, only the Storm diſcovers what it was. Morality it ſelf requires a better rooting of virtuous Habits, than that they ſhould be ſet only in looſe Ground, thrown up by Extremity of Condition, and not in the Soil it ſelf.</p>
                  <p>That Repentance which will not bear the trial of time, will much leſs ſuſtain the Teſt of Eternity, wherein every thing that ſtands, muſt be ſolid and
<pb n="71" facs="tcp:99379:141"/> ſubſtantial: Things that ſuffer the loſs of themſelves, when they are tried <hi>by mans day,</hi> will ſuddenly be conſumed by the hotter Beams of God. 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 4.3.</p>
                  <p>That hath need of good Founding, that muſt un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dergo an Eternity, and have all advantage of Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>coction, that muſt be laid up for ever; which the ſhort Moments of a Death-Bed without a miraculous Aſſiſtance will not allow. The Fruit of it general<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, like <hi>that Haſty-ripe, periſhes while it is in the Hand:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſai. 28.4.</note> This Repentance gives up the Ghoſt, as ſoon as it is born.</p>
                  <p>Now as for that place in <hi>Ezekiel,</hi> ſo much vexed with Controverſie, I do not think it convenient for me to intangle a Diſcourſe intended wholly for pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctice with the Perplexities of it.</p>
                  <p>Only I am concerned to ſhew, that it doth not afford the favour ſuppoſed to this kind of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance. For firſt, We muſt not miſtake <hi>the day</hi> it ſpeaks of, as if it ſignified ſo ſtrait a compaſs of Time, as a Day; but that Seaſon wherein either the righteous Man waſts and deſtroys his Righteouſneſs; or a Sinner over comes his Vitious Cuſtoms and In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clinations, neither of which are uſually done on the ſudden. Secondly, <hi>The turning from Wickedneſs</hi> intended is certainly a ſincere and impartial one, and not ſuch as we have rendred this Dying Repentance ſuſpicious to be. Thirdly, It muſt be juſtified <hi>by a walking in the Statutes and Judgments of God, and doing that is right;</hi> that is, by a continued Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>formation, which will leaſt agree to this Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, and therefore this place of Scripture will not protect this Suppoſition, but rather damns it.</p>
                  <pb n="72" facs="tcp:99379:142"/>
                  <p>Having now in the foregoing Diſcourſe, in a pra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctical and perſwaſive way, endeavoured to engage Men to a timely Repentance, by ſetting out the hazard of a late one: I have thought it neceſſary, to make the ſtate of the whole Doctrin, as exact as I can, by conſidering whatever might with fair appearance of Scripture-Reaſon call into queſtion and ſcruple, what I have grounded my Perſwaſions upon.</p>
                  <p>I will therefore, as a Supplement to all I have ſaid, Firſt recollect what I have intended all along. And then caſt all, I can poſſibly ſuppoſe againſt it, into <hi>Objections</hi> and <hi>Anſwers,</hi> that by cloſer atenti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on to the Caſe it ſelf, every one that will be at the coſt to conſider it, may be convinced to the main End, <hi>viz.</hi> A preſent Religious Life.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. Firſt then I make it not the queſtion, Whe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther a true Repentance, how late ſoever, be a Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to Salvation?</p>
                  <p n="2">2. Nor Secondly, Whether God hath reſerved it to the Prerogative of his Grace, to give a true Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance at laſt?</p>
                  <p n="3">3. Nor Thirdly, Whether a Repentance that is true and ſincere, though but in the Seeds, being ſurprized with a Death-Bed, may not then break out and ſhew it ſelf more fully?</p>
                  <p n="4">4. Nor Laſtly, Whether a Man that hath the light of the Goſpel brought to him, but juſt before his Dying Condition, may not expect the Grace of God working with it then, even as in the freer times of Life?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>All theſe I do</hi> with great Confidence acknow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ledge: The Subſtance of what I have ſaid againſt a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance,</hi> will be compriſed in theſe
<pb n="73" facs="tcp:99379:142"/> following Aſſertions, which I reſtrain wholly to Men, that have lived under the Light, and Exhor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tations, and Applications of the Word of God, with all uſual Freedom; and yet have not begun ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerely to Repent, till they come to die.</p>
                  <p>The Firſt is, That a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance</hi> how fair ſoever, it may appear, hath yet the greateſt Doubt imaginable upon it, whether it be true.</p>
                  <p>The Second, There is greateſt Reaſon of Fear, God will not give his Grace to ſuch a Dying Man, to Repent.</p>
                  <p>The Third, That a Repentance at Death is not that <hi>general Repentance,</hi> the Scripture Diſcourſes of, makes promiſes of Pardon upon, offers the Aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtances of the Spirit to, enjoins the Duty of, with ſo many preſſing commands. For that Repentance immediately to be begun is ſuppoſed to govern a following Life. It muſt therefore be an extraordi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nary, and miraculous Repentance, if true.</p>
                  <p>Laſtly, That it is therefore againſt all rules of Pie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty and Prudence, by miſpending Life to caſt our ſelves upon the neceſſity of Repentance at Death.</p>
                  <p>This, I ſay, is the Subſtance of what I have de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſigned all along, and which I would now further clear, and vindicate from theſe following Objections.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection</hi> 1. Doth not the Parable of calling ſome Labourers into the Vineyard at the Eleventh Hour, imply, That God doth in ordinary Convert ſome at the laſt Hour, as well as ſooner?<note place="margin">Mat. 20. <hi>v.</hi> 1. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>
                     </note>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> The main ſcope of Parables is only argu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentative, and <hi>ſo far as the ſcope of</hi> that Parable relates to this Caſe: It is no more, than what I acknowledge, That God gives Eternal Life to true
<pb n="74" facs="tcp:99379:143"/> Repentance, if true, at laſt, even as to the firſt and earlieſt Repentance. The reward being to all of <hi>Grace, and not of Debt.</hi> It is alſo to be conſidered, there remained an Hour of working, repreſenting rather old Age, than a Death-Bed, if the colours of a Parable prove any thing, and ſo are rather againſt this Repentance, than for it.</p>
                  <p>In the <hi>Second Objection,</hi> I ſuppoſe Men taking Sanctuary at infinite Mercy and Power in this man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner.</p>
                  <p>Although no thought of Man can reach the Mercy, that accepts or gives Repentance at the laſt: yet Mercy being as much above our Thoughts, as the Heaven above the Earth, what can we define con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning it? And though there are ſo many Circum<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtances of Impoſſibility, according to our meaſure of things; Yet the things that are impoſſible with Men, with God are poſſible; for with God all things are poſſible: How can we then determine in this Caſe? <hi>Can we by ſearching find out the Almighty</hi> in his Mercy and Power? <hi>Can we find him out to perfection? It is high as Heaven, what can we do? It is deeper than Hell, what can we know? The meaſure thereof is longer than the Earth, and broa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der than the Sea.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer.</hi> Now becauſe in this <hi>Objection,</hi> the ſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>news of all Hope and Expectation from this late Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance meet; I will endeavour to give the moſt punctual <hi>Anſwer</hi> to it. And though I know after all, that is, or can be ſaid, Men will not quit it: Yet I ſhall reſt upon this <hi>Anſwer,</hi> as my laſt Reſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lution of this Caſe; and by it raiſe the diſſwaſions from a truſt in ſuch a Repentance to the height; the greatneſs of the hazard appearing moſt fully from it.</p>
                  <pb n="75" facs="tcp:99379:143"/>
                  <p>In general therefore it hath been noted, The que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion is not whether God accepts a true Repentance, how late ſoever; but whether God will give a true Repentance ſo late; and herein the queſtion is not of the limits, the abſolute limits of infinite Mercy and Power; But what limits it hath ſet to it ſelf? and what Seaſons it hath limited to us? and whether ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording to theſe a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance</hi> be not almoſt, if not altogether an Impoſſibility? I'll therefore lay down ſeveral degrees of Impoſſibility, notwithſtanding infinite Mercy and Power, that muſt neceſſarily abate the Irregular Confidence of ſuch a Repentance, and under one of them I ſhall be bold to place it.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. The higheſt degree of Impoſſibility is, of thoſe things, that are utterly and abſolutely <hi>impoſſible with God,</hi> becauſe they are irreconcileable with his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and ſuch wherein if they were, <hi>he muſt deny himſelf,</hi> which he cannot do. For though there is nothing above God, not ſo much as any Goodneſs, or Righteouſneſs abſtracted from himſelf, that ſhould give him Law; Yet he being himſelf that ſu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preme Goodneſs and Righteouſneſs, He is a Law to himſelf; His Nature is his ſupreme and inviolable Law; And his Will ſtands always even with his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture: For his Will is himſelf reciprocal with his Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture; And all his Actions keep perfect Correſpon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dence with his Will. Upon this immutable Reaſon <hi>God cannot lye,</hi> he cannot do any thing weak, or that argues Imperfection: He cannot but be righteous in all his ways, and holy in all his works. Upon this Reaſon alſo he cannot, <hi>he will not acquit the guilty.</hi> He cannot, he will not ſave or make Men happy in their Sins. God himſelf ſpeaks this
<pb n="76" facs="tcp:99379:144"/> Senſe, <hi>Ezek.</hi> 18.31, 32. and <hi>c.</hi> 33.11. <hi>As I live ſaith the Lord, I have no pleaſure in the Death of him that dieth, why will ye die? Turn your ſelves and live ye.</hi> As if he ſhould ſay, except ye turn, all my Mercy can do you no good. For ſuch a Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy as God the <hi>Father</hi> of <hi>Mercies,</hi> will not give, would not be a Mercy, but either a fooliſh Softneſs, or looſe Indulgence to Sin. Such a Power were not a Power, but an Impotency, or turning all things to Confuſion. Theſe therefore are as inconſiſtent with God, as Folly, Imperfection, Sin. The Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pel, the higheſt diſplay of Mercy reſts upon this Principle, being not a Salvation of Men in Sin, but a moſt effectual Redemption of Men from Sin. Of all that God can be ſuppoſed to do for Men, there is nothing more impoſſible than this, more repug<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant to all the true Senſe of Man, more overthrow<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of the undertaking of Chriſt, more contrary to the Nature of true Happineſs. An Opinion of the damned in Hell being annihilated, or recovered to Holineſs and Happineſs after ſome Ages of Torment, were a high Probability compar'd with this. He that can tempt himſelf to believe this, may believe any thing, and needs no Confutation, but his own Unreaſonableneſs. Againſt this I have been thus large, becauſe it ſecretly lurks in Mens Hearts, that God may ſave them without ſo much ado about Faith and Repentance, though being afraid to ſpeak a thing ſo monſtrous, they diſguiſe it under the Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tence of a faint Repentance at laſt.</p>
                  <p>But from what I have ſaid, It is plainly to be in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ferred, Firſt, That ſome things which God cannot, will not do, are not the reproach either of his Mercy or Power, but the Glory and Greatneſs of both. And this, that He neither can, or will ſave Men
<pb n="77" facs="tcp:99379:144"/> without ſincere Faith and Repentance (that is with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out a recovery to Holineſs) is one of theſe things. The <hi>Death-Bed Repentance</hi> then, that is <hi>unto Sal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vation,</hi> muſt without all diſpute be a ſincere Change from Sin to Holineſs.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. There is an Impoſſibility, that ariſes from the peremptory, and abſolute, and irrepealable determi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation of the Will and Council of God concerning any thing. In this degree of things I account,<note n="*" place="margin">I cannot ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quieſce in the Expoſition of the Learned Dr. <hi>Hammond</hi> in his Annota<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions concern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing theſe two Caſes.</note> 
                     <hi>the unpardonableneſs of the Sin againſt the Divine Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit. The unrenewableneſs of total Apostates from Chriſtianity to Repentance. The impoſſibility of Repentance after this Life:</hi> Now though theſe carry not their own Evidence of being inconſiſtent with the Divine Nature, as the former; yet the Declaration of ſupreme pleaſure againſt them is ſo effectual, that we muſt needs look upon them, as impoſſible. And we may ſee a great conſent, a high Congruity be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween the things themſelves, and the Determination of God concerning them, which Reaſons are yet clearer with God. For in the Sin againſt the Holy Ghoſt there is ſo mature, ſo perfect, ſo concocted a Wickedneſs, ſo high a contumely againſt the God<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>head it ſelf, that it is very irreconcileable with Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance, and ſo with Pardon. The total Apoſta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy from Chriſtianity, and the Evidences of it men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tioned <hi>Heb.</hi> 6. from the very Nature of the Caſe ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pears irreparable, becauſe there is no other or high<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er Grace, than that of the Goſpel, for the Apoſtates to remove to; <hi>no more ſacrifice for ſin,</hi> nor are
<pb n="78" facs="tcp:99379:145"/> there any higher Evidences of that Goſpel, than thoſe he is ſuppoſed to revolt from; and no more perfect Acts of Contrariety to the Goſpel, than <hi>the crucifying the Son of God afreſh and putting him to an open ſhame, the doing deſpite to the Spirit of Grace, the treading under foot the Son of God, and counting the Blood of the Covenant an unclean thing, in the Parallel place.</hi> Heb. 10.29.</p>
                  <p>Beſides all other Reaſons, the unchangeable State of Eternity is ſo conſolidate with, ſo fixed into our very Being, that the Perpetuity of it is very account<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>able to our Reaſon; ſo that there can be no Change after this Life.</p>
                  <p>From hence then, we derive thus much farther againſt a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance:</hi> Firſt that ſome things, wherein we cannot find an expreſs Impoſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity in their Nature, are yet made ſo by Gods abſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lute Reſolution concerning them; into the Reaſon of which he alſo is pleaſed to give us ſome light: And that many Expreſſions of Scripture (as, <hi>They ſhall ſeek me early but ſhall not find me,</hi> the Parable of the fooliſh Virgins, with many others) make this Repentance very dangerous, with which alſo the very Reaſon of the Caſe concurs; Yet not a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mounting to this kind of Impoſſibility.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. There are ſome things impoſſible according to the Rules, and general Laws of the Creation, and Government of the World, which we call Na<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ture, and which Rules, infinite Wiſdom and Power hath ſo preſcribed to it ſelf, that he hath yet reſerved to himſelf freedom to ſhew himſelf above them, as Founder and Lord of Nature.</p>
                  <p>Thus it is impoſſible for the Sun to ſtand ſtill, to raiſe the Dead, that the Fire ſhould not burn: That
<pb n="79" facs="tcp:99379:145"/> is, It is impoſſible at all times, but when infinite Power is pleaſed to be ſeen riding in the Heavens, far above all Nature, that is, when he is pleaſed to work Miracles: ſuitable to theſe Laws of the firſt Creation, there are alſo Laws of the new and ſecond Creation, <hi>viz.</hi> the Redemption of Chriſt.</p>
                  <p>It is true, the new Creation, compared with the old, is ſo far as it is new, <hi>All Miracle.</hi> Such is <hi>Righteouſneſs without Works,</hi> Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>generation;<note place="margin">Rom. 4.6.</note> Such is the Incarna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, the Reſurrection. Even as the firſt Creation and daily Preſervation are Miracles compared with <hi>that nothing,</hi> out of which all things were drawn, and are ſtill upheld.</p>
                  <p>Yet this very miraculous Frame of the Goſpel is bounded with certain Laws and Rules, and when theſe are tranſcended, it is a Miracle in this miracu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lous ſtate of things.</p>
                  <p>Now all Inſtances of miraculous Power are rare and extraordinary, and the Reaſons of them, when they have been, have always been great and ſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lemn; and when they have been more plentiful in any Age, the Reaſons have been great for that alſo. And in Miracle it ſelf, there hath been always regard to the natural ſtate of things. Miracle hath for the moſt part lifted up Nature only, wherein it was ei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther decayed, or not planted ſo high, as the very effect to be wrought, and juſt then deſigned; not minding the flouriſh of it ſelf, but the main In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tention only: We read of no other Circumſtances but thoſe of ordinary Mortality, into which they that were raiſed from the Dead in Scripture were exalted; only that they were raiſed to Life.</p>
                  <p>In the new Creation, ſo much of the old, as would ſerve in it, is generally taken in; and the
<pb n="80" facs="tcp:99379:146"/> Conſtitutions that will agree with the deſign of Grace are upheld for the moſt part; as were eaſie to manifeſt. Divine Inſpiration did not diſannul the natural Temper of the Prophets or Apoſtles; but they are eaſily obſervable in their Writings. Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verſion doth not deſtroy, but ſanctifie and renew Nature. For what doth all this ſerve, but to ſhew, God does as little as may be, decline from the firſt Model of things, His Wiſdom ſo deeply con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trived?</p>
                  <p>Further, the new Creation in all things excelling the old; as the whole State of it is never antiquated by a higher Revelation, ſo the Laws of it are ſel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dom exceeded by any thing extraordinary; yet I acknowledge, Inſtances there are of Extraordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ries, even here alſo.</p>
                  <p>The Apoſtleſhip was in a manner wholly mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>culous, yet the calling of the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſomething higher than that; for whereas the Twelve were trained, and educated in the Diſcipline and Converſation of Chriſt; and expreſs care in the Surrogation of one into the place of <hi>Judas,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Acts 1.21, 22.</note> was had of ſuch a Pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>paration, yet the Apoſtle <hi>Paul</hi> was ſuddenly born into that high Function and Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thority, into which they were gradually admitted. But the reaſon alſo was very high, That there might be ſo great a Proof of the Power of the Goſpel, as a Perſecutor and Blaſphemer Preaching that Faith,<note place="margin">Acts 9.20, 21, 22.31. Gal. 1.23, 24.</note> he had ſo no<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>toriouſly perſecuted; and on the ſudden, that it might be without the Suſpicion of a Confederacy.</p>
                  <pb n="81" facs="tcp:99379:146"/>
                  <p>His very Converſion was a Su<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perabundance of <hi>Abundant Grace:</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.14. <gap reason="foreign" resp="#OXF">
                           <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                        </gap>.</note> He was not only in a deep Humility of Expreſſion, but in the thing it ſelf, one of the <hi>chiefeſt of Sinners</hi> ſaved by Chriſt:<note place="margin">1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>verſ.</hi> 13.</note> His Sin had been the unpardonable Sin, had not <hi>Ig<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>norance</hi> abated it.</p>
                  <p>But upon that ſolemn account <hi>he obtained mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cy; That in Him Jeſus Christ might ſhew forth a Pattern of all long-ſuffering,</hi> 1 Tim. 1. <hi>verſ.</hi> 16.</p>
                  <p>This of the Dying Malefactor, I Eſteem of the ſame kind, and the Reaſon was extraordinary, as I have before obſerved.</p>
                  <p>I have now thus fully diſcourſed this Particular, becauſe it brings me to the ultimate Reſolution, I can make of this Caſe; that is,</p>
                  <p>A <hi>Death-Bed Repentance</hi> whenever it is true, is a Grace and Favour vouchſafed to the Soul, in which it is found, above the ordinary and general Grace that gives Repentance. For it is above theſe four great Rules of the Goſpel, wherein alſo the fundamental Nature of things much conſpires.</p>
                  <p n="1">1. That God is jealous of the Glory of his Grace, and gives it by the ſame rule, he preſcribes to us. <hi>To day, while it is called to day, hear his Voice.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p n="2">2. God attempers his Grace to the ſtate of Man's Soul, ſo as not to permit to ſuch a long hardning, and accuſtomedneſs in Sin, thoſe whom he intends to Convert.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. The Ingenuity and Freedom of the Soul ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſary to Repentance is not ordinarily poſſible, amidſt the Fears and Neceſſity of Death.</p>
                  <pb n="82" facs="tcp:99379:147"/>
                  <p n="4">4. <hi>Fruits meet for Repentance, and amendment Life, and the glorifying God upon Earth,</hi> by a ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Converſation are univerſally required. Such a Repentance then muſt be proportionable to <hi>a Mira<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cle, a Miracle in Grace.</hi> Now Miracles are ſeldom, and not but upon ſuch Reaſons as exceed the value of thoſe Rules (at leaſt) in that Caſe, wherein they are over-ruled; Reaſons of greater Eminency than what daily fall out; but it is a daily Reaſon, that Men muſt either Repent or Periſh. Such Repentances therefore are very rare, and doubtleſs when they are, God gives a luſtre to the Reaſons why they are; In ſuch a meaſure, that Men may ſay, <hi>Here is the finger of God,</hi> ingraving his Wiſdom upon his Work. And with ſuch a Freedom as our Saviour expreſſes, <hi>Luke</hi> 4.25, 26, 27.</p>
                  <p>The practical Concluſion then from hence is this, It is as preſumptuous a <hi>Boaſt</hi> for a Man to think, He ſhall Repent when he comes to die,<note place="margin">Prov. 27.1.</note> becauſe the Mercy and Power of God are infinite; as for him upon the ſame accounts, to leap into Seas, or roll himſelf in Flames, without fear of danger.</p>
                  <p>Nay, It is ſuch a kind of prophane Inſolency, as ſome Interpreters give that of <hi>Lamech</hi> to be, <hi>Though I ſhould ſlay a Man in my anger, or a Young-man in my Senſe of an Injury:</hi>

If Men having made a Profeſſion of Religion, have done many things reli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>giouſly and ſoberly, and yet through the prevalency of ſome Luſts, it appears they have not truly repent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed?

                  <p>Beſides all the Doubts already inſiſted upon, ſuch Men have made a Cuſtom of deluding Religion, and have great cauſe to fear they ſhould do ſo at laſt.</p>
                  <pb n="85" facs="tcp:99379:148"/>
                  <p>God alſo is <hi>ſo provoked by ſuch,</hi> as have <hi>long tempt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed him, proved him, and ſeen his works, and yet err from him in their hearts, and do not know his ways, that he comes to his oath againſt them,</hi> Heb. 3.9, 10.</p>

                  <p>Any good thing found in Men, either in their Life or Death, though it have not the worthineſs of <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance to Salvation,</hi> yet ſhall certainly <hi>have its re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward</hi> in mitigations of Puniſhment; which Conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration fully explained at the Day of Judgment will aſſoyl many of this ſort of Doubts concerning the ways of God. I believe thoſe <hi>very early ſeekings</hi> of God, notwithſtanding which, he is ſaid <hi>to laugh at the Deſtruction</hi> of thoſe, from whom they come, when they have firſt ſerved the gloryings of Juſtice, obtain leſſenings of Pain: as conquered Enemies, after they have been led in Triumph to wait on the Conqueror's Glory, may have even that Service recompenſed with a more compaſſionate Captivity.</p>

                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 3. If there have been ſolidity and ſincerity in any religious Exerciſes in the time of Life, where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>by the Heart by the Grace of God is prepared for further Grace; as very often Converſion is by de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grees: It is hopeful God may uſe Death, as a Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of compleating his Work; yet this is to be regi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtred among the ſeldomer diſpoſes of God, and both thoſe Preparations, and the Complement of them is under the caution of our Saviour: <hi>Strive to enter in at the ſtrait gate, for many, I ſay unto you, ſhall ſeek to enter, and ſhall not be able,</hi> Luke 13.24.</p>

                     <hi>Objection</hi> 5. Is it not at all times a great Folly, to promiſe <hi>a to morrow</hi> to Repentance, how long ſoever we may live after that to morrow? becauſe we daily <hi>harden through the deceitfulneſs of ſin.</hi> Is it not alſo always a curious Point, and that requires a great jea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>louſie over it, whether our Hearts are at any time ſincere in returns to God? Is it not laſtly, always to be feared, leſt our <hi>to day,</hi> the time of Grace ſlip from us? Why then are the dangers placed ſo induſtriouſly upon this Repentance at Death?</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſwer</hi> 1. Firſt as concerning the time of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, It is to be acknowledged; Every Man, that is come to the ſtrength and fixedneſs of his Under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtanding, to the poize and inclination of his Will and Affections, to the habit and cuſtom of his Life and Actions, and hath not determined for God, hath great reaſon to fear; leſt as there is a deep print of the high hand of Nature upon his unconverted ſtate, ſo there ſhould be a Seal of Juſtice alſo, and this Doubt increaſes every day.</p>
                  <p>Notwithſtanding this; All Doubts and Scruples, that have an appearance of inſnaring and intangling the minds of Men with fears, they begin too late, are to be avoided; if it be not ſo late, that it is <hi>juſt now dark, and their feet ſtumbling upon the dark mountains;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Jer. 13.16.</note> And theſe things being written eſpecially for the <hi>living,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Iſa. 38.19.</note> who have in ordina<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry probability time to loſe, the dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger is beſt placed here, where it takes them every way.</p>
                  <p>By the way of Encouragement; that the time is not yet paſt, while they have the ſpaces of Life, and of the Patience of God; which is not <hi>a ſlackneſs of Juſtice</hi> but <hi>a deſigned Salvation.</hi> By the way of
<pb n="87" facs="tcp:99379:149"/> Caution, becauſe they know not how ſoon they may be caſt upon a Death-Bed, and this Patience be at an end: With Dying Men the caſe is otherwiſe, who are already in the thickeſt of the Danger, and muſt work themſelves out in that moment, or periſh for ever; without any Injury therefore to them, <hi>the liv<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing</hi> are thus to be warned. <hi>Iſa.</hi> 38.19.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Further,</hi> It is evident, all delays of Repentance roll down hither, however Men propoſe a ſtop; yet hither the generality come at laſt: So that in effect, it is all one, whether Men are diſſwaded from truſt<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to a Dying Repentance, or from delaying their Repentance. For if they are given to delay; It comes to this, They repent and die together. But if a Man be afraid to venture Eternity upon his laſt Breath, he will repent preſently.</p>
                  <p n="2">2. For the difficulty of being ſincere in Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance, I place it here, becauſe, though every Man ſhould by drawing the parallel lines of Deluſion, and miſtake upon himſelf, try his Repentance when ever it is; yet theſe Errors fall in greateſt numbers upon that point of Extremity, and with leaſt poſſibility of rectifying them: But ſeeing there are at all times ſuch deceits in this Caſe, there is nothing ſo neceſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſary, as to repent in a clear light, and full leiſure.</p>
                  <p n="3">3. For the ſeverity of God in denying his Grace, though I acknowledge his Indignation condemns many, who have dallied with him and their own Souls to be ſuck'd in again by the whir-pool of their Luſts, when they would have riſen out of them; yet this Indignation is never ſo certainly at the height, as when Men have provoked it as long as they could: It is moſt miſerable therefore to make our laſt motions within the command of ſuch a hor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rible
<pb n="88" facs="tcp:99379:150"/> Pit, leſt they prove only the ſtruggles of ſink<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Men: yet this we muſt do, if we are not before got out of it. There is much greater hope (how bad ſoever their Condition may be) to them, who are yet in the hand <hi>of patience lifting and leading them to Repentance,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Rom. 2.4. 2 Pet. 3.9.</note> 
                     <hi>and do not deſpiſe it, but account it Salvation.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Objection</hi> 6. This Doctrin does not ſavor enough of the Grace of the Goſpel, that would have all Men come to Repentance.</p>
                  <p>
                     <hi>Anſw.</hi> To diſcourſe the Severities of the Goſpel, to the ends of the Goſpel, is moſt Evangelical Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe. For as the Goſpel doth with all clearneſs declare its own Rigors, that Men might not miſtake it, for a looſe and careleſs Doctrin, and ſo miſs the Salvation of it; ſo have I diſcovered the great ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>zard of a Dying Repentance, that Living Men might be perſwaded not to caſt themſelves upon it, and Dying Men excited to an Action ſuitable to the ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tremity of their Caſe.</p>
                  <p>And this is indeed preaching the Goſpel; and to be moved <hi>upon it with fear, to prepare an Ark to the ſaving our Souls</hi> before the flood come,<note place="margin">Heb. 11.7.</note> is as true an effect of Faith, <hi>as to be conſtrained by love to live to him,</hi>

                     <hi>that hath</hi> died for us. I ſay as true, and gives us a Title to the <hi>Inheritance of the Righteouſneſs, which is by Faith,</hi> together with the other. For the Prudence of Faith makes us apprehenſive of the Reaſons of Danger, and ſo to Fear, even as the Gratitude of it ties us with the Obligations of Love. This is not that Fear that Love caſts out, but that it ſelf quickens,
<pb n="89" facs="tcp:99379:150"/> and is alſo both quickned and guarded by it: nor <hi>is it the bondage, but the wiſdom of Fear.</hi> Rom. 8.15. Job 28.28.</p>

<pb n="90" facs="tcp:99379:151"/> conſiders Life, and that he hath but a Moment of it, and that therefore he would live that Moment, as much as may be he; ſhall find the higheſt of Life, the top of Life to be <hi>Godlineſs, which hath all the promi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes of this life, and of that which is to come,</hi> 1 Tim. 4.8.</p>
                  <p>To purſue this World, and the Vanities of it is not only with greateſt folly, and impertinency to lanch our ſelves in a great Veſſel, the Greatneſs of our Affection; and with ſolemn Preparations, our ſtrongeſt Action, into the low water, the ſhallow of Life; which becauſe it cannot carry ſo great a bulk, increaſes the Toyl and Vexation, as well as enhanſes the Vanity and Folly of doing nothing at ſo great an expenſe: But worſe than this, it is the loading our ſelves with guilt under a deluſion of Pleaſure; that gives us ſecret diſquiet and torment, while we are laying it on; and cannot be laid down as we pleaſe; but with more ſenſible and induſtrious Anguiſh, than we heap'd it upon us, I mean, the ſenſe of our miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>doings, and Contrition for them, ſo neceſſary <hi>to work Repentance.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>To conclude, Seeing <hi>to die is the end of all Men,</hi> Eccleſ. 7.2. Repentance is to be choſen while we live, that we may die with the greateſt quiet; with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out thoſe Agonies of Conſcience, thoſe cold Sweats, thoſe ſinking Eyes, and fainting Spirits; for he dies with moſt eaſe, that moſt ſurveys Death, and looks into all the Retirements of it before-hand; that knows it perfectly, and all its ſtrength; ſuch an one governs himſelf in it, as in a moſt important Action with Decency and Freedom. He is not hal'd by Death, but received by it: <hi>Into thy hands I commend my ſpirit;</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 23.46.</note> he
<pb n="91" facs="tcp:99379:151"/> lays himſelf orderly into the ſhade of Death: Where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>as ſo long adherence to the Pleaſures of Sin gives Death a Violence. It makes Men both unwilling, and afraid to die. <hi>This night thy Soul ſhall be required.</hi>
                     <note place="margin">Luke 12.20.</note> Life is exacted of a Senſualiſt, and torn from him, that is reſigned by a Spiritual and Mortified Man; Good Men die in an active Senſe, they know how to die; others die paſſively, they are forced to die.</p>
                  <p>This great difference prefers to us Dying daily, before that forcible Dying at once.</p>
                  <p>The wiſdom of Dying was accounted by Heathens one of the worthy Buſineſſes and Imployments of Life, and that required much ſtudy. Chriſtianity gives us the true Rules of it, and they lie <hi>in waiting till our change come; Time is ſhort,</hi>
                     <note place="margin">1 Cor. 7.29.</note> 
                     <hi>they therefore that uſe</hi> this World, ſhould not uſe it down to the Bran, ſenſually; but only take the advantages of it to a higher Life: Elſe being met on the ſudden by Death, they are like thoſe that fall off from Life with Violence, that is, Headlong; but they that live in the Senſe of God, and an Eternal Condition, alight with care and eaſe.</p>
                  <p>It is therefore not only greateſt Safety, but trueſt Frugality and Improvement of Life to Repent be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times; and when we come to die, the eaſieſt and ſweeteſt way of dying. Not indeed a Dying, but a Tranſlation into Immortality and Bleſſedneſs.</p>

                  <p>If therefore the Repentance be ſuch, as He, as this <hi>Great Prince</hi> hath given; There is in it a <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing to God by Him,</hi> and then his <hi>Salvation</hi> is to all <hi>Perfection</hi> to it; For as going into the Heavens in his Spirit, He took in his Paſſage this Prey, the Dying Malefactor out of the Mouth of the Lyon; So as He pleaſes, out of the ſame Power, the <hi>power of the Dog,</hi> He reſcues thoſe Souls that he hath made dear to Himſelf; for He living ever, quickens whom He will, and He can by his Spirit ſeal this his Grace in a Moment.</p>
                  <p>For this <hi>Great High Prieſt-Hood,</hi> being the <hi>Eternal Prieſt-Hood of Chriſt;</hi> whatever is ſaid of Him, as a <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> muſt be ſaid of Him; as this <hi>High-Prieſt,</hi> which He is alway, or with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out leaſt Intermiſſion: And as ſuch an <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> therefore it is, that He <hi>ſuccours the Tempted,</hi> be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing in <hi>All things Tempted,</hi> as we are, yet with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out Sin; now even as his Great <hi>Temptation</hi> was at <hi>Death;</hi> yet without the Sin of having defer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>red his <hi>ſtrong Cries,</hi> and <hi>Supplications</hi> to Death, though then He was moſt Earneſt: He can there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore
<pb n="94" facs="tcp:99379:153"/> Succour, and be infinitely Compaſſionate, even to thoſe who are Tempted, though with, and in this Sin of having delay'd Repentance to the laſt. They therefore, whom He graciouſly moves to it, may <hi>come,</hi> even then, <hi>boldly to the Throne of Grace,</hi> and <hi>obtain Mercy,</hi> and <hi>find Grace,</hi> even in this <hi>juſt Seaſon,</hi> and as it were indiviſible Point of Time: <hi>Theſe Things I write,</hi> that we may <hi>not Sin</hi> this <hi>Great Sin of Delaying our Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> to the laſt; But if any Man do <hi>ſo Sin,</hi> we have this <hi>Great High-Prieſt over the Houſe of God;</hi> an <hi>Advocate,</hi> and a <hi>Propitiation;</hi> and if ſuch a one be under his Charge, and <hi>given to Him</hi> by God, He is a <hi>Faithful</hi> and a <hi>Merciful High-Prieſt:</hi> He is therefore Faithful, becauſe Mer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciful to make <hi>Reconciliation,</hi> and to Succour in ſo great a Temptation, as even This is: This He can do, becauſe He is a Fore runner within the Veil; and by his Blood appears, as he that hath obtained Eternal Redemption, a Redemption always ready.</p>
                  <p>This is the great Security and Cordial againſt the Fear of Death in general, to the Saints and Servants of Chriſt; and if by its <hi>Hyper-Pleonaſm,</hi> its exceeding Abundance, and Affluence, it may and does over-flow to ſome, upon whom the <hi>Grace of Chriſt Abounds,</hi> much more where <hi>Sin</hi> hath ſo much <hi>Abounded:</hi> How great is this Miracle of Grace! But who? How few are they who ſhall thus Live? whom God and Chriſt will pleaſe to make thus to Live, When it is come to this; for if they are <hi>Few</hi> that are <hi>Saved,</hi> how much <hi>Fewer</hi> are the <hi>Saved,</hi> at this laſt Point.

                  </p>
                  <p>There is too much of (eſpecially the Death-Bed) Repentance, at is Repentance of the <hi>Lamp</hi> only, that makes a ſhew only; that is but only of this World, and from beneath; which is able for once to give or yield a fair and lightſome Flaſh at parting with the World: But becauſe without a Treaſure to Enter into an Eternal Du<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, That which is but a <hi>Lamp,</hi> fails in the very time of Tryal, and becomes <hi>a Lamp put out in obſcure Darkneſs.</hi> Let your Lamps be always Shining, and your Lights Burning, ſuch as are Able to be always ſo, and ſo to Shine even into Eternity.</p>

From what hath been ſpoken con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning the Great <hi>Mourning</hi> and <hi>Repentance,</hi> that ſhall be before the End of this ſtate of the World; even before the <hi>pouring out of the Vials,</hi> in that Miraculous ſtate of Things, that ſhall be after the <hi>Apoſtacy</hi> ended, and the <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> in Suc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion; I conclude there ſhall be a <hi>Death-Bed Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pentance</hi> of the World, if I may ſo call it; but after that, <hi>viz.</hi> in the time of the <hi>Vials</hi> we read of no <hi>Repenting,</hi> but a <hi>Repenting not;</hi> no more than in the ſtate of <hi>Everlaſting Puniſhment,</hi> in our ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neral Apprehenſion of that State: even as <hi>He that is Righteous,</hi> ſhall be <hi>Righteous ſtill,</hi> that is, for ever <hi>Righteous,</hi> and in no poſſibility of for ever Falling from it; any more than from the Glory, and Happineſs of Eternity, in our General No<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion of that State.</p>
                  <pb n="96" facs="tcp:99379:154"/>
                  <p>And this ſtrongly Argues to us the Poſſibili<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ties of a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance;</hi> ſeeing all the Prejudices that lie upon and againſt a <hi>Death-Bed-Repentance</hi> now, lie againſt that late Repentance of the World; but yet it limits and guards againſt the Ordinarineſs and Eaſineſs of a <hi>Death-Bed Repentance</hi> in General; in as much as this late Repentance is in a miraculous ſtate of things, <hi>viz.</hi> of the <hi>Spirit poured</hi> out; of ſuch a Glori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous <hi>Kingdom of Chriſt</hi> come into its Succeſſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on; and at the time when <hi>our Lord</hi> ſhall immedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ately <hi>Come in his Kingdom.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>But then at the ſame time is cut off all poſſibi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lity of Repentance after this Seaſon of Repen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tance; For as ſoon as the time of the Vials en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ters, all poſſibility of Repentance is fore-doom'd, as hath been ſaid.</p>
                  <p>Now this Late Repentance ſhall be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cited and ſtirred up to by the <hi>Preaching</hi> of the <hi>Everlaſting Goſpel;</hi> and of this there were two great <hi>Symbols</hi> or <hi>Figures</hi> given in the very firſt Appearance of the Goſpel, <hi>viz.</hi> the <hi>Apoſtle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhip</hi> of <hi>Paul,</hi> who was, as hath been obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved, <hi>Born out of due Time</hi> into that High <hi>Miſſion;</hi> agreeable to which is the <hi>Preaching of the Everlaſting Goſpel:</hi> and the <hi>Repentance</hi> of the <hi>Dying Malefactor,</hi> juſt as Chriſt was <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tring into his Kingdom;</hi> And they are each a <hi>Hypotypoſis,</hi> or <hi>Pattern</hi> for them who ſhall <hi>Hereafter Believe on Him to Life Everlaſting;</hi> and <hi>Repent</hi> with <hi>the Repentance to Salva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi>
